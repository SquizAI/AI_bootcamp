## What Is This?

This is an **interactive AI tutor** that will test your prompt engineering skills! You'll paste a special "meta-prompt" into Google Gemini, and it will become your personal tutor that:

- Teaches you 7 different prompt techniques
- Asks you to create prompts for each technique
- Gives you feedback on every prompt you write
- Lets you revise to earn more points
- Grades you out of 100 points at the end

## Time Management Guide

<div align="center">

| Pace | Duration | Best For |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **Standard** | 45-60 minutes | Most students |
| **Fast** | 35-45 minutes | Quick workers |
| **Thorough** | 60-75 minutes | Those using revisions |

</div>

<blockquote>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Don't rush! Taking time to create good prompts is better than rushing through. Quality always beats speed!
</blockquote>

## Success Strategy

### Before You Start

<div align="left">

- [ ] **Completed Class 1 & 2** from the curriculum
- [ ] **Reviewed your notes** on **R.C.T.F.** (Role, Context, Task, Format)
- [ ] **Have your prompt templates** handy for reference
- [ ] **Found a quiet place** where you can focus

</div>

### During the Assessment

<div align="left">

- [ ] **Read carefully** - The tutor gives specific requirements for each section
- [ ] **Be specific** - Vague prompts get lower scores
- [ ] **Use real examples** - Base your prompts on real schoolwork
- [ ] **Take revisions** - You can earn back points! Use that opportunity
- [ ] **Show your learning** - Include academic integrity constraints
- [ ] **Don't rush** - Quality > speed

</div>

### For Each Prompt You Write

Ask yourself these critical questions:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

- Did I include a **clear role**?
- Did I provide **detailed context**?
- Is my **task** specific and clear?

</td>
<td width="50%">

- Did I request a **format**?
- Would this **actually help me learn** (not just get an answer)?
- Is this **academically honest**?

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Being Too Vague
"Help me with math" ‚ùå

‚Üí Instead: Specify the topic, your level, and what you need

### Not Including Context
Skipping your knowledge level ‚ùå

‚Üí Instead: "I'm in 9th grade algebra, struggling with..."

### Forgetting Constraints
No academic integrity checks ‚ùå

‚Üí Instead: "Help me learn, not do my homework"

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Asking AI to Do the Work
"Write my essay" ‚ùå

‚Üí Instead: "Show me how to structure..."

### Rushing Without Feedback
Ignoring tutor comments ‚ùå

‚Üí Instead: Read feedback carefully and revise

### Skipping Revisions
Accepting low scores ‚ùå

‚Üí Instead: Use revision opportunities to earn back points

<div align="center">

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|:---|:---|
| All required components present and detailed | Shows complete understanding |
| Very specific and clear | AI produces better, more useful responses |
| Shows sophisticated understanding | Demonstrates mastery of the technique |
| Would produce really useful AI response | Practical application of skills |
| Maintains academic integrity | Ethical and honest work |

</div>

## Troubleshooting Guide

### The AI tutor isn't responding correctly

<blockquote>
Make sure you copied the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> meta-prompt (it's long!). Try starting a new conversation in Gemini and re-paste the meta-prompt carefully.
</blockquote>

### I'm stuck on a section

<blockquote>
Read the tutor's example carefully. Think about real homework you've done. Ask yourself: What would make this prompt specific and useful? Reference your class notes on R.C.T.F.
</blockquote>

### I don't understand what the section wants

<blockquote>
The tutor explains each technique before asking you to do it. Look at the example provided. Identify what components the example includes. Try to create something similar for your own scenario.
</blockquote>

### Can I use my notes or templates?

<blockquote>
<strong>YES!</strong> This is an open-note assessment. You can reference your class materials and look at your prompt templates. Just don't copy-paste without customizing for your own learning needs.
</blockquote>

### What if I get a low score on a section?

<blockquote>
The tutor offers you a chance to revise - <strong>TAKE IT!</strong> Read the feedback carefully and make specific improvements. You can earn back up to 3 points per section.
</blockquote>

### How do I know if I'm doing well?

<blockquote>
The tutor gives you feedback after each section:
- Scores of 12+ are excellent
- Scores of 10-11 are good
- Scores below 10 mean you should definitely revise
- Your scores should improve as you go through sections
</blockquote>

---

## After Assessment: What's Next?

### Your Teacher Will:

- Review your conversation/screenshots
- Verify your scores
- May adjust scores slightly (¬±5-10 points)
- Use results to identify if you need extra help

### You Should:

- Read your final performance report carefully
- Note which techniques you're strong at
- Practice techniques you scored lower on
- Apply what you learned to real schoolwork and future assessments
