# Class 1: Foundations + Role-Based Prompting

## üéØ Class Overview

This 90-minute session introduces students to prompt engineering fundamentals and role-based prompting techniques. Students learn the anatomy of effective prompts and how to use AI as an expert learning partner across all their subjects.

**This is the foundation** for all future prompt engineering skills. Students who master these basics will be able to get significantly better help from AI tools immediately.

## üìã Learning Objectives

By the end of this class, students will be able to:

1. **Explain** what prompt engineering is and why it matters
2. **Identify** the four key components of an effective prompt
3. **Apply** role-based prompting to get expert-level help
4. **Provide** appropriate context for their learning needs
5. **Craft** clear, specific prompts for their actual homework
6. **Evaluate** AI responses for helpfulness and accuracy
7. **Modify** prompts based on the quality of responses received

## üéì Key Concepts

### 1. Prompt Engineering
The practice of crafting effective instructions for AI tools to get useful, accurate, and helpful responses. Think of it as learning how to ask better questions to get better answers.

### 2. Role-Based Prompting
Assigning the AI a specific expert role to guide its responses:
- "Act as a math teacher..."
- "You are a history expert..."
- "Pretend you're a writing tutor..."

### 3. Context Engineering
Providing the AI with relevant background information about:
- Your current level of understanding
- What you've already learned
- What specific help you need
- The subject and grade level

### 4. The Four Components of Effective Prompts
1. **Role**: Who should the AI be?
2. **Context**: What background does the AI need?
3. **Task**: What exactly do you want the AI to do?
4. **Format**: How should the response be structured?

## üìö Materials Needed

### For Students
- Computer or tablet with internet access
- Google Gemini account (free)
- Current homework or study materials to practice with
- Note-taking materials (digital or paper)

### For Educators
- Projector or screen sharing capability
- Google Gemini open and ready to demonstrate
- Student examples prepared (see student-examples folder)
- Backup internet connection if possible
- Printed handouts of prompt templates (optional)

## üéØ Success Criteria

Students successfully completing this class will be able to:

**Minimum Proficiency:**
- Write a basic role-based prompt
- Include context about their grade level and subject
- State a clear task or question
- Get a response from Gemini that helps them understand something

**Target Proficiency:**
- Write detailed role-based prompts with specific context
- Adjust prompts based on initial responses
- Apply prompting to multiple different subjects
- Explain why their prompt structure works

**Advanced Proficiency:**
- Create sophisticated prompts combining multiple roles
- Provide nuanced context about learning preferences
- Anticipate what information AI needs before asking
- Help peers improve their prompts

## üè† Homework Assignment

**"Prompt Engineering in Action"**

Students will:
1. Choose 3 different subjects they're currently studying
2. Create a role-based prompt for each subject using class templates
3. Test each prompt in Google Gemini
4. Screenshot or copy both the prompt and response
5. Write 2-3 sentences about what worked and what didn't
6. Come to Class 2 ready to share one example

**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes

**Purpose:** Immediate application reinforces learning and builds confidence. Students discover what works for their personal learning style.

## üí° Teaching Tips

### Engagement Strategies
- Start with a "bad prompt vs. good prompt" comparison
- Use real student subjects for all demonstrations
- Have students share current homework challenges
- Celebrate when prompts work well
- Normalize iteration‚Äîfirst prompts rarely perfect

### Differentiation

**For 7th Graders:**
- Use more concrete examples
- Focus on one subject at a time
- Provide more structured templates
- Allow more practice time

**For 9th Graders:**
- Introduce some complexity in scenarios
- Encourage experimentation
- Discuss why techniques work
- Foster peer learning

**For 11th Graders:**
- Present advanced role combinations
- Discuss academic integrity more deeply
- Challenge them to create original templates
- Encourage teaching others

### Common Challenges

**"The AI gave me the answer directly"**
‚Üí Show how to add "don't give me the answer, help me understand" to prompts

**"This isn't working for my math problem"**
‚Üí Demonstrate breaking complex problems into smaller questions

**"I don't know what role to use"**
‚Üí Provide the role selection guide from templates

**"Is this cheating?"**
‚Üí Address this head-on: explain learning assistance vs. shortcutting

## üîó Connections to Future Classes

- **Class 2**: Multi-step prompting builds on role-based foundation
- **Class 3**: Gemini Studio allows saving favorite roles as system instructions
- **Class 4**: Personal learning systems incorporate refined role-based prompts

## üé¨ Getting Started

**If you're teaching tomorrow:**
1. Read lesson-plan.md completely
2. Open slides.md and prepare your presentation
3. Test the example prompts in Gemini yourself
4. Review exercises and choose which to emphasize
5. Have backup examples ready for different subjects

**If you're learning independently:**
1. Read through slides.md to understand concepts
2. Try each exercise in order
3. Use the templates to create your own prompts
4. Test with your real homework
5. Review student examples for inspiration
