## Quick Review: Integration in Action

### Look at This Prompt

```
You are an expert chemistry tutor working with a high school student.

I'm studying chemical equilibrium and understand Le Chatelier's
principle in theory, but I'm struggling to apply it to real problems.
I tend to get confused about which direction the equilibrium shifts.

Here's an example of how I want you to help:
Problem: "If we increase the pressure..."
Your response: "Let's think through this step by step. First, what
happens to the number of molecules when pressure increases?..."

Now help me with this problem: If we add more reactant A to the
system A + B ‚áå C + D, which direction does equilibrium shift?

Don't just tell me the answer‚Äîguide me to figure it out. Use
questions and step-by-step reasoning.
```

### What Techniques Do You See?

**Identify:**
- Role-based prompting ‚úì
- Context engineering ‚úì
- Few-shot example ‚úì
- Multi-step structure ‚úì
- Constraints/negative prompting ‚úì

**This is integration:** Multiple techniques working together seamlessly

## Part 2: Sustainable Learning Workflows

---

## What is a Learning Workflow?

### Definition
A **workflow** is a repeatable step-by-step process you follow for common academic tasks

### Why Workflows Matter
- **Consistency**: Same process = reliable results
- **Efficiency**: No reinventing the wheel
- **Quality**: Proven steps = better outcomes
- **Habit**: Becomes automatic over time

### Workflows Use Your Library
- Each step uses relevant library prompts
- Library = tools
- Workflows = how you use them

---

## Workflow 1: Problem Set Assistance

### The Process

**Step 1: Independent Attempt**
- Try all problems yourself first
- Mark where you get stuck
- Note specific confusion points

**Step 2: Targeted AI Help**
- For stuck problems only
- Use prompt: "I'm stuck at [specific step] because [reason]"
- Focus on understanding the concept, not getting the answer

**Step 3: Independent Completion**
- Complete the problem yourself
- Apply what you learned
- Don't look at AI

**Step 4: Verification**
- Use AI to check your work
- Understand any mistakes

## Part 3: Academic Integrity & Ethics

---

## The Big Question

### Using AI: Help or Cheating?

**The honest truth:**
- The line isn't always clear
- Different teachers have different rules
- You need a framework for making good decisions

**What we'll do:**
- Develop decision-making tools
- Discuss real scenarios
- Create your personal guidelines

**Important:**
- Your school's policy comes FIRST
- These are frameworks, not universal rules
- When in doubt, ask your teacher

---

## The Learning vs. Shortcutting Test

### Five Critical Questions

**1. UNDERSTANDING TEST**
- ‚úì Can I explain this concept after using AI?
- ‚úó Did I just copy without understanding?

**2. SKILL DEVELOPMENT TEST**
- ‚úì Am I building skills I need to learn?
- ‚úó Am I bypassing skills I'm supposed to develop?

**3. ASSIGNMENT PURPOSE TEST**
- ‚úì Does AI help me meet the learning objectives?
- ‚úó Does AI let me avoid the intended learning?

**4. INDEPENDENCE TEST**
- ‚úì Could I do this without AI after learning with AI?
- ‚úó Will I always need AI for this task?

**5. TRANSPARENCY TEST**
- ‚úì Would I be comfortable telling my teacher how I used AI?
- ‚úó Am I hiding my AI use because I know it's wrong?

### Rule of Thumb
Green checks = Appropriate learning support
Red X's = Crossing the line into dishonesty

---

## Ethical Scenario 1

### Math Problem Set

**Situation:**
You have a math problem set with 10 problems. You solve the first one yourself but get stuck. You use AI to understand the concept, then solve the remaining 9 problems independently.

**Questions:**
- Are you learning or shortcutting?
- Would this be appropriate?

### Analysis
‚úì **APPROPRIATE**

**Why?**
- You attempted independently first
- Used AI to understand, not to solve
- Applied learning independently
- Built genuine skills
- Could explain your work

**Key:** AI helped you learn the concept

---

## Ethical Scenario 2

### Essay Writing

**Situation:**
You have an essay due tomorrow. You paste the prompt into AI and ask it to write the essay. You read it, make a few small changes, and submit it as your work.

**Questions:**
- Are you learning or shortcutting?
- Would this be appropriate?

### Analysis
‚úó **NOT APPROPRIATE**

**Why?**
- You bypassed all the learning
- Didn't develop writing skills
- Can't explain the thinking
- Avoided assignment's purpose
- This is plagiarism

**Key:** AI did your thinking for you

---

## Ethical Scenario 3

### Essay Feedback

**Situation:**
You write your essay draft yourself. You share it with AI asking: "What's weak about my argument? What evidence am I missing?" You then research those gaps and revise your work yourself.

**Questions:**
- Are you learning or shortcutting?
- Would this be appropriate?

### Analysis
‚úì **APPROPRIATE**

**Why?**
- You wrote the original work
- Using AI like a writing tutor
- Still doing the revision work
- Developing critical thinking
- Could cite AI feedback

**Key:** AI provided feedback, you did the work

---

## Ethical Scenario 4

### Citation Question

**Situation:**
You use AI to explain a complex history concept. You understand it deeply and write your analysis in your own words, incorporating what you learned. You don't mention AI anywhere in your paper.

**Questions:**
- Does this require citation?
- What's the right approach?

### Analysis
**GRAY AREA** - Depends on School Policy

**Considerations:**
- Some schools require citing AI assistance
- Others don't for concept explanations
- Similar to: Do you cite your teacher for explaining?
- Writing is yours, understanding aided by AI

**Best Practice:**
- Check your school's policy
- When in doubt, cite
- Be transparent about your process

**Example citation:**
"I used AI to understand [concept] before developing this analysis."

---

## Ethical Scenario 5

### Test Time

**Situation:**
It's test day. You're stuck on a question. You secretly use AI on your phone under your desk to help you answer it.

**Questions:**
- Are you learning or shortcutting?
- Would this be appropriate?

### Analysis
‚úó **DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE**

**Why?**
- This is clearly cheating
- Tests measure what YOU know
- No assistance allowed
- Violates test conditions
- Could result in serious consequences

**Key:** Tests are independent measures of learning

---

## When and How to Cite AI Use

### Know Your School's Policy

**Some schools require:**
- Citation for any AI use
- Disclosure on major assignments
- Specific citation formats

**Some schools allow:**
- Learning assistance without citation
- Feedback tools uncited
- Concept explanation uncited

**Best Practice:**
- Ask your teacher when unclear
- Over-communicate rather than hide
- Be transparent about your process

---

## Citation Examples

### In an Essay
```
"I used Google Gemini to understand the historical context
of the French Revolution and to provide feedback on my draft
argument structure. All writing and analysis are my own."
```

### On Problem Sets
```
"I used AI assistance to understand the concept of derivatives
after attempting problems 1-3 independently. I then applied
this understanding to complete the remaining problems without
AI assistance."
```

### General Acknowledgment
```
"AI tools (Google Gemini) were used to support my learning
and provide feedback during the development of this work.
All final ideas, analysis, and writing are my own."
```

### In Your Workflow
Keep notes of when and how you used AI for each assignment

---

## Your Personal Ethical Guidelines

### Draft Your Own Rules

**Questions to Answer:**

**1. What will I ALWAYS do?**
- Attempt work independently first?
- Use AI only after getting stuck?
- Cite when required?
- Focus on understanding, not just answers?

**2. What will I NEVER do?**
- Submit AI-written work as my own?
- Use AI during tests?
- Copy without understanding?
- Hide AI use when I should disclose?

**3. What types of assignments?**
- Where is AI most appropriate?
- Where should I avoid AI?
- Where is AI somewhere in between?

**4. How will I cite?**
- What citation format?
- When will I disclose use?
- How will I document my process?

**5. How will I ensure genuine learning?**
- What checks will I use?
- How will I verify understanding?
- What independence tests?

---

## The Golden Rule of AI Use

### "Am I learning or am I shortcutting?"

**If AI helps you understand ‚Üí Appropriate**
**If AI does your thinking ‚Üí Inappropriate**

**You are the learner. AI is the tool.**
