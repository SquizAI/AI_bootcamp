## 1. GEMINI AI STUDIO FEATURES

### 1.1 System Instructions

**What Are System Instructions?**
- Set of instructions processed BEFORE user prompts
- Define how the model behaves and responds throughout entire conversations
- Especially useful for information users cannot see or change
- Apply to entire request across multiple user-model turns
- Subject to standard data use policies

**Key Use Cases:**
1. **Define Persona or Role** - Specify the assistant's identity and expertise
2. **Define Output Format** - Control response structure (Markdown, JSON, HTML)
3. **Define Output Style and Tone** - Control verbosity, formality, reading level
4. **Define Goals or Rules** - What the model should/shouldn't do
5. **Provide Additional Context** - Background information for prompts

**Best Practices:**

```
Example for Educational Context:

System Instruction:
"You are an expert educator specializing in [subject]. Follow these instructions:
- Keep responses concise and age-appropriate for [grade level]
- Break down complex concepts into digestible steps
- Use real-world examples relevant to students
- Encourage critical thinking with follow-up questions
- Maintain an encouraging, supportive tone
- If a student is struggling, provide hints before solutions"
```

**Educational Application Examples:**

Professional Tone:
```
System Instructions: "Write in a professional tone."
Result: Formal, structured, detailed explanations
```

Casual Tone:
```
System Instructions: "Write in a casual tone."
Result: Conversational, relatable, engaging explanations
```

### 1.2 Structured Prompts & Prompt Design Strategies

**Core Prompt Components:**

1. **Input Types:**
   - Question Input: Model answers questions
   - Task Input: Model performs actions
   - Entity Input: Model operates on data
   - Completion Input: Model completes partial content

2. **Constraints:**
   - Specify what to do and what NOT to do
   - Define length, scope, and boundaries
   - Example: "Summarize this text in one sentence"

3. **Response Format:**
   - Specify desired output structure
   - Use completion strategy to guide formatting
   - Supports JSON, Markdown, tables, lists, etc.

**Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Prompting:**

Zero-Shot (No examples):
```
Prompt: "Classify the sentiment of this review"
```

Few-Shot (With examples):
```
Examples:
Review: "Amazing product!" → Sentiment: Positive
Review: "Terrible experience" → Sentiment: Negative

Review: "It was okay" → Sentiment: ?
```

**Educational Recommendation:** Always use few-shot examples for consistent formatting and educational scaffolding.

**Breaking Down Complex Tasks:**
```
Instead of: "Solve this math problem"

Use:
1. First, identify what variables are given
2. Determine what formula applies
3. Show your calculation step-by-step
4. Verify your answer makes logical sense
```

**Adding Context:**
```
Context: "This is a high school physics class studying Newton's Laws"
Prompt: "Explain force = mass × acceleration"
Result: Age-appropriate explanation with relevant examples
```

### 1.3 Multimodal Input Capabilities

**Supported File Types:**

**Images:**
- PNG, JPEG, WEBP
- Maximum resolution: 3072x3072 (scaled)

# Upload inline
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[
        types.Part.from_bytes(
            data=file_data,
            mime_type='application/pdf'
        ),
        "Summarize this document"
    ]
)
```

2. **File API (> 20MB or multiple uses):**
```python
# Upload via File API
myfile = client.files.upload(file="path/to/large_file.pdf")

# Use in multiple requests
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[myfile, "Analyze this document"]
)
```

**Multimodal Prompting Best Practices:**

1. **Be Specific:** Point to aspects of image/video you want analyzed
2. **Add Examples:** Show desired output format with examples
3. **Break Down Steps:** For complex analysis, request step-by-step processing
4. **Specify Output Format:** Request tables, JSON, markdown as needed
5. **Put Media First:** For single-image prompts, place image before text

**Educational Use Cases:**
- Analyze student work (handwritten, diagrams)
- Process educational videos for summaries
- Extract information from textbook pages
- Create accessible content from visual materials
- Provide feedback on visual presentations

## 2. AGENT STUDIO CAPABILITIES & PROMPT DESIGN

### 2.1 Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)

**What is ADK?**
The Agent Development Kit is Google's framework for building stateful, memory-enabled AI agents that can:
- Maintain long-term memories across sessions
- Execute multi-step workflows
- Use tools and function calling
- Integrate with Vertex AI services

**Key Components:**

1. **Agent Definition:**
```python
from google import adk

agent = adk.Agent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    name='educational_assistant',
    instruction="""You are an educational assistant designed to help students learn.

    1. Assess student understanding before providing answers
    2. Break down complex concepts progressively
    3. Provide hints before solutions
    4. Adapt explanation complexity to student responses
    5. Keep responses under 100 words initially
    """,
    tools=[adk.tools.preload_memory_tool.PreloadMemoryTool()]
)
```

2. **Memory Service (VertexAiMemoryBankService):**
- Stores long-term memories keyed by user_id
- Retrieves relevant memories automatically
- Generates memories from conversation sessions
- Scoped by user_id and app_name

3. **Session Service:**
- Manages conversation context
- Tracks multi-turn interactions
- Enables progressive learning

**Memory Bank Features:**

**Generate Memories:**
```python
# After a learning session
memory_service.add_session_to_memory(session)
# Memories stored: {"user_id": "student_123", "app_name": "math_tutor"}
```

**Retrieve Memories:**
```python
# Automatic retrieval with PreloadMemoryTool
# Memories loaded at start of each turn
response = runner.run(
    user_id="student_123",
    session_id=session.id,
    new_message="Help me with algebra"
)
# Agent recalls: student struggles with quadratic equations, prefers visual examples
```

**Educational Agent Design Patterns:**

1. **Adaptive Tutor:**
```python
instruction = """You are an adaptive math tutor.
- Track student's mastery of each concept
- Adjust difficulty based on performance
- Provide harder problems when student excels
- Offer more scaffolding when student struggles
- Celebrate progress and growth
"""
```

2. **Socratic Method Agent:**
```python
instruction = """You are a Socratic tutor.
- Never give direct answers
- Guide with clarifying questions
- Help students discover solutions themselves
- Validate student reasoning process
- Point out logical inconsistencies gently
"""
```

3. **Writing Coach:**
```python
instruction = """You are a writing coach.
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Focus on one improvement area at a time
- Acknowledge strengths first
- Suggest revisions with examples
- Track writing progress over time
"""
```

### 2.2 Agent Prompt Design for Education

**Prompt Structure for Agents:**

```
[ROLE & IDENTITY]
Define who the agent is and their expertise

[CONSTRAINTS & RULES]
What they should/shouldn't do

[INTERACTION STYLE]
How they communicate with users

[TASK APPROACH]
How they handle different scenarios

[MEMORY USAGE]
How they use stored information

[ASSESSMENT CRITERIA]
How they evaluate understanding
```

**Example - Personalized Learning Agent:**

```python
instruction = """

4. Adjust complexity based on student responses
5. Connect new learning to previously mastered concepts

INTERACTION RULES:
- Keep explanations under 75 words initially
- Use encouraging language
- Ask one clarifying question per response
- Celebrate correct reasoning, even if answer is wrong
- Never provide complete homework solutions

MEMORY USAGE:
- Recall student's favorite topics and examples
- Track concepts student has mastered
- Note areas needing reinforcement
- Remember preferred learning styles (visual, kinesthetic, etc.)
"""
```

## 3. DOCUMENT UPLOADS, LINKS & MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION

### 3.1 File API - Comprehensive Guide

**Storage Limits:**
- 20 GB total storage per project
- 2 GB maximum per file
- 48-hour automatic retention
- Free in all regions

**Upload Workflow:**

1. **Small Files (< 20MB) - Inline:**
```python
# Direct upload
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[file_bytes, "Analyze this"]
)
```

2. **Large Files - File API:**
```python
# Upload once, use multiple times
uploaded_file = client.files.upload(file=local_path)

# Use in different prompts
summary = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[uploaded_file, "Summarize"]
)

questions = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[uploaded_file, "Generate 5 quiz questions"]
)
```

3. **Multiple Documents:**
```python
# Process multiple PDFs together
doc1 = client.files.upload(file="textbook_chapter1.pdf")
doc2 = client.files.upload(file="textbook_chapter2.pdf")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[
        doc1,
        doc2,
        "Compare key concepts between these chapters"
    ]
)
```

**File Metadata Management:**

```python
# Get file info
file_info = client.files.get(name=file.name)
print(f"Name: {file_info.name}")
print(f"URI: {file_info.uri}")
print(f"Size: {file_info.size_bytes}")
print(f"MIME: {file_info.mime_type}")

# List all files
for f in client.files.list():
    print(f.name, f.create_time)

# Delete file
client.files.delete(name=file.name)
```

### 3.2 Document Processing Best Practices

**PDF Processing:**
- Each page = 258 tokens
- Max 1000 pages
- Pages scaled to 3072x3072 or 768x768
- Preserves layouts, tables, charts
- Native vision understanding

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Rotate pages to correct orientation**
2. **Avoid blurry pages**
3. **Place text prompt after document for single docs**
4. **Use context caching for repeated queries**

**Educational Use Cases:**

```python
# Textbook Analysis
textbook = client.files.upload(file="biology_textbook.pdf")

# Extract key concepts
concepts = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[
        textbook,
        "Extract key concepts from Chapter 3 in JSON format"
    ],
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        response_mime_type="application/json"
    )
)

# Generate study questions
questions = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[
        textbook,
        "Create 10 multiple choice questions with answers"
    ]
)

# Create differentiated materials
beginner = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[
        textbook,
        "Rewrite Chapter 3 summary for 6th grade reading level"
    ]
)
```

### 3.3 Multimodal Content Integration

**Combining Multiple Modalities:**

```python
# Video + Document + Question
video = client.files.upload(file="lecture.mp4")
slides = client.files.upload(file="lecture_slides.pdf")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[
        video,
        slides,
        "Create a study guide that combines concepts from both the video lecture and slides"
    ]
)
```

**Image + Text for Visual Learning:**

```python
# Student diagram analysis
diagram_bytes = load_image("student_diagram.png")

feedback = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[
        types.Part.from_bytes(diagram_bytes, mime_type="image/png"),
        """Analyze this student's concept map:
        1. Identify correctly placed concepts
        2. Note any misconceptions
        3. Suggest improvements
        4. Provide encouraging feedback"""
    ]
)
```

## 4. API FEATURES FOR PROGRESSIVE LEARNING & CONTEXT RETENTION

### 4.1 Context Caching for Cost-Effective Learning

**Two Types of Caching:**

**1. Implicit Caching (Automatic - Gemini 2.5 models):**
- Enabled by default
- Automatic cost savings on cache hits
- Minimum: 1,024 tokens (Flash) or 4,096 tokens (Pro)
- No configuration needed

**Optimization Tips:**
- Put large, common content at beginning of prompt
- Send similar requests in short time windows

**2. Explicit Caching (Manual - Most models):**
- Developer-controlled
- Guaranteed cost savings
- Configurable TTL (time to live)
- Cost: 4x less than regular input tokens

**Educational Implementation:**

```python
# Cache course materials for semester
course_materials = client.files.upload(file="course_textbook.pdf")

# Create cache with 1-hour TTL
cache = client.caches.create(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
    config=types.CreateCachedContentConfig(
        display_name='biology_course_materials',
        system_instruction="""You are a biology tutor.
        Use the provided textbook to answer questions.
        Provide page references for all answers.""",
        contents=[course_materials],
        ttl="3600s"  # 1 hour
    )
)

# Use cache for multiple student queries (4x cheaper!)
def answer_student_question(question, student_id):
    return client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
        contents=question,
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            cached_content=cache.name
        )
    )

# Extend cache if needed
client.caches.update(
    name=cache.name,
    config=types.UpdateCachedContentConfig(
        ttl='7200s'  # Extend to 2 hours
    )
)
```

**When to Use Explicit Caching:**
- Chatbots with extensive system instructions
- Repetitive analysis of lengthy documents
- Frequent queries against large document sets
- Course materials referenced throughout semester

**Cost Example:**
- Regular input: $X per 1M tokens
- Cached input: $X/4 per 1M tokens
- Storage: Based on TTL duration

### 4.2 Long Context Windows (1M+ tokens)

**Context Window Capabilities:**

**Gemini Models:**
- 1 million token context window
- 2 million token window (some models)
- Processes multimodal content

**What 1M Tokens Enables:**
- 50,000 lines of code
- 8 average novels
- 200+ podcast transcripts
- Entire textbook chapters
- Multiple course documents

**Educational Applications:**

```python
# Entire course context
textbook = client.files.upload(file="full_textbook.pdf")
syllabus = client.files.upload(file="syllabus.pdf")
assignments = client.files.upload(file="all_assignments.pdf")

# Student can ask about any course material
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[
        textbook,
        syllabus,
        assignments,
        "Where in the course do we cover photosynthesis, and what is the related assignment?"
    ]
)
```

**Long Context Best Practices:**

1. **Query Placement:** Put query at END of prompt for best performance
2. **Cost Management:** Use context caching for repeated long-context queries
3. **Multiple Needles:** For multiple pieces of information, consider multiple queries
4. **Performance:** ~99% accuracy for single-item retrieval

**Many-Shot In-Context Learning:**

```python
# Provide hundreds of examples for consistent grading
grading_examples = """
[Example 1] Essay: "..." → Grade: A, Feedback: "..."
[Example 2] Essay: "..." → Grade: B, Feedback: "..."
...
[Example 100] Essay: "..." → Grade: B+, Feedback: "..."

Now grade this essay: [Student Essay]
"""

# Model learns grading criteria from examples
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=grading_examples
)
```

### 4.3 Progressive Learning Implementation

**Session-Based Learning:**

```python
# Track student progress across sessions
from google.adk.sessions import VertexAiSessionService

session_service = VertexAiSessionService(
    project=project_id,
    location=location,
    agent_engine_id=agent_engine_id
)

# Session 1: Introduction
session1 = await session_service.create_session(
    app_name="algebra_tutor",
    user_id="student_123"
)

call_agent("Teach me about linear equations", session1.id, "student_123")
# Agent introduces concepts at student level

# Generate memories from session
memory_service.add_session_to_memory(session1)
# Stores: "Student understands variables, struggles with negative numbers"

# Session 2: Building on Prior Knowledge
session2 = await session_service.create_session(
    app_name="algebra_tutor",
    user_id="student_123"
)

call_agent("I need help with my homework", session2.id, "student_123")
# Agent recalls: student understands variables, adapts explanation accordingly
```

**Adaptive Difficulty:**

```python
system_instruction = """
Track student mastery levels:
- Novice: Needs step-by-step guidance
- Intermediate: Can solve with hints
- Advanced: Can solve independently

Adjust problem difficulty based on success rate:
- 80%+ correct → Increase difficulty
- 50-80% correct → Maintain level
- <50% correct → Decrease difficulty, provide more scaffolding
"""
```

**Spaced Repetition Integration:**

```python
# Store concepts and last review time in memory
call_agent("Review concepts due for reinforcement", session.id, user_id)
# Agent retrieves: "Quadratic formula last reviewed 7 days ago, due for review"
# Provides targeted practice
```

Response: "The answer is 42"
```

✅ Good:
```
Prompt: "Help student solve this problem"
System Instruction: "Never provide direct answers. Guide with questions."
Response: "What information do you have? What are you trying to find?"
```

**Principle 2: Differentiation**

```python
# Generate materials at multiple levels
base_content = "Photosynthesis lesson"

beginner = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=f"Rewrite for 4th grade: {base_content}"
)

intermediate = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=f"Rewrite for 8th grade: {base_content}"
)

advanced = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=f"Rewrite for AP Biology: {base_content}"
)
```

**Principle 3: Formative Assessment**

```python
system_instruction = """
After each explanation:
1. Ask a probing question to check understanding
2. Wait for student response
3. Provide feedback on their reasoning
4. Adjust next explanation based on their answer
"""
```

**Principle 4: Metacognition Support**

```python
instruction = """
Encourage students to think about their thinking:
- "How did you approach this problem?"
- "What strategies did you try?"
- "Where did you get stuck, and why?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"
"""
```

### 5.3 Educational Use Cases & Prompts

**Use Case 1: Lesson Planning**

```python
prompt = """
Create a 45-minute lesson plan on [topic] for [grade level]:

"""
```

**Use Case 4: Personalized Practice**

```python
# Agent recalls: student struggles with fractions
prompt = """
Generate 5 fraction problems that:
1. Start slightly below student's current level (build confidence)
2. Progress to current challenge level
3. Include one real-world application
4. Provide immediate hints if needed
5. Celebrate correct reasoning
"""
```

**Use Case 5: Multilingual Learning Support**

```python
prompt = """
