## Minute-by-Minute Breakdown

### 0:00-0:10 | Review & Integration Overview (10 min)

**Objective:** Students understand how techniques work together and feel confident about their progress

**Script/Talking Points:**
> "Welcome to our final class! Over the past three sessions, you've learned powerful techniques for using AI as a learning partner. Today, we're bringing it all together and building systems you'll use long after this course ends. You're going to create your own personal AI learning system."

**Activities:**

1. **Celebration & Acknowledgment** (2 min)
   - "Think about where you started vs. where you are now"
   - "You've learned: role-based prompting, multi-step techniques, few-shot learning, AI Studio, and more"
   - "Today you become independent AI users with your own systems"

2. **Quick Review Game** (4 min)
   - Display a complex prompt on screen:
   ```
   You are an expert chemistry tutor working with a high school student.

   I'm studying chemical equilibrium and understand Le Chatelier's principle
   in theory, but I'm struggling to apply it to real problems. I tend to
   get confused about which direction the equilibrium shifts.

   Here's an example of how I want you to help:
   Problem: "If we increase the pressure..."
   Your response: "Let's think through this step by step. First, what
   happens to the number of molecules when pressure increases?..."

   Now help me with this problem: If we add more reactant A to the system
   A + B ‚áå C + D, which direction does equilibrium shift?

   Don't just tell me the answer‚Äîguide me to figure it out. Use questions
   and step-by-step reasoning.
   ```

   - Ask: "What techniques do you see in this prompt?"
   - Students identify: role-based, context, few-shot, multi-step, constraints
   - Point out: "This is integration‚Äîmultiple techniques working together"

3. **Today's Mission** (2 min)
   - "You'll build three things today:"
   - "1. A personal prompt library you can use forever"
   - "2. A learning workflow for how you'll use AI"
   - "3. Ethical guidelines you can trust"
   - "By the end, you'll have a complete AI learning system"

4. **Set Expectations** (2 min)
   - Final project work time is built into class
   - Use real homework‚Äîmake this immediately useful
   - No such thing as a "perfect" system‚Äîyours should fit YOU
   - Share and learn from each other

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What techniques did you see in that complex prompt?"
- "What are we building today?"

**Differentiation:**
- 7th grade: Emphasize building tools they can use right away
- 9th grade: Focus on efficiency and organization
- 11th grade: Discuss sophistication and long-term value

### 0:10-0:25 | Building Your Prompt Library (15 min)

**Objective:** Students understand how to organize and build reusable prompt collections

**Key Concept:** A prompt library is an organized collection of your best prompts that you can reuse and adapt over time.

**Activities:**

1. **What is a Prompt Library?** (3 min)
   - "A library is NOT just a list of random prompts"
   - "It's an organized system of prompts that solve your specific learning needs"
   - "Think of it like your personal toolkit‚Äîorganized by what you need to do"

   Show example organization:
   ```
   MY PROMPT LIBRARY

   üìö BY SUBJECT
      - Math
      - Science
      - English
      - History

   [specific question].

   Please explain this concept using:
   1. Simple language
   2. A real-world analogy
   3. A visual description or example
   4. Then check my understanding with a question

   Don't give me practice problems yet‚ÄîI need to understand the concept first.

   NOTES ON USE:
   - Fill in brackets with specifics
   - Works best when I'm specific about what I do/don't understand
   - Can ask follow-up questions in same conversation

   VARIATIONS:
   - Add "I'm a visual learner" for more diagrams/examples
   - Add "I learn best with practice" to get problems after explanation

   LAST USED: [date]
   EFFECTIVENESS: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5)
   ```

   - Point out: This is reusable, adaptable, documented
   - "You'll create 15+ entries like this today"

3. **Organizing Strategies** (3 min)

   Present multiple organization options:

   **Option 1: By Subject**
   - Best for students with strong subject focus
   - Easy to find subject-specific prompts quickly

   **Option 2: By Task Type**
   - Best for cross-subject learners
   - "Explaining" prompts work across all subjects

### 0:25-0:40 | Sustainable Learning Workflows (15 min)

**Objective:** Students create repeatable processes for common academic tasks

**Key Concept:** A workflow is a step-by-step process you follow every time you do a certain type of task. It turns good habits into automatic routines.

**Activities:**

1. **What is a Learning Workflow?** (3 min)

   Present the concept:
   - "A workflow is your process for using AI for specific academic tasks"
   - "Instead of figuring it out each time, you have a proven system"
   - "Like a recipe‚Äîfollow the steps, get consistent results"

   Show simple example:
   ```
   ESSAY WRITING WORKFLOW

   Step 1: Brainstorming (no AI yet)
      - Read assignment carefully
      - Note initial thoughts
      - Identify what I don't understand

   Step 2: Research Support (AI-assisted)
      - Use research prompts to understand context
      - Ask AI to explain historical background
      - Get different perspectives on topic

   Step 3: Outline Development (AI-assisted)
      - Share my initial ideas with AI
      - Ask for feedback on logic flow
      - Request suggested evidence sources

   Step 4: Draft Writing (minimal AI)
      - Write first draft myself
      - Use AI only for word choice or grammar questions

   Step 5: Revision (AI-assisted)
      - Ask AI to critique argument strength
      - Request feedback on paragraph transitions
      - Check citation format

   Step 6: Final Polish (minimal AI)
      - Final proofreading myself
      - Use AI only for unclear sentences
   ```

2. **Four Essential Workflows** (6 min)

   Present and briefly explain each:

   **Workflow 1: Problem Set Assistance**
   ```
   1. Attempt problems independently first
   2. For stuck problems: identify exactly where I'm stuck
   3. Use specific prompts to understand that step
   4. Complete problem independently
   5. Use AI to check work and reasoning
   6. Learn from mistakes for next problems
   ```

   **Workflow 2: Concept Mastery**
   ```
   1. Read/attend lesson on concept
   2. Note what I don't understand
   3. Use explaining prompts for confusion points
   4. Create examples myself
   5. Use AI to verify understanding
   6. Practice with AI-generated similar problems
   ```

   **Workflow 3: Research & Writing**
   ```
   1. Understand assignment requirements
   2. Brainstorm independently
   3. Use AI for background research
   4. Develop thesis/argument myself
   5. Use AI for feedback and gaps
   6. Write with minimal AI assistance
   7. Revise with AI feedback
   ```

   **Workflow 4: Study & Test Prep**
   ```
   1. Review materials and notes
   2. Identify weak areas
   3. Use AI to create practice tests
   4. Take practice test without AI
   5. Use AI to understand missed questions
   6. Repeat for mastery
   ```

   - "Choose 1-2 workflows most relevant to you"
   - "Adapt these to fit your learning style"

3. **Workflow Design Exercise** (4 min)

   Students create/adapt one workflow:
   - "Think about a task you do regularly in school"
   - "Map out: What steps? When use AI? When work independently?"
   - Quick share: 2-3 volunteers share their workflows
   - Class feedback and suggestions

4. **Building Workflows into Your Life** (2 min)

   Practical implementation:
   - "Start with ONE workflow, master it"
   - "Once it's automatic, add another"
   - "Your workflows will evolve‚Äîthat's normal"
   - "Document what works so you can repeat it"

   Show how workflows connect to library:
   - "Each workflow step uses library prompts"
   - "Library = tools, Workflows = how you use them"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between a prompt and a workflow?"
- "Which workflow would help you most right now?"

**Differentiation:**
- 7th grade: Focus on 1-2 simple workflows
- 9th grade: 2-3 workflows with some complexity
- 11th grade: Multiple sophisticated workflows, encourage innovation

### 0:40-0:55 | Academic Integrity Deep Dive (15 min)

**Objective:** Students develop clear ethical frameworks for AI use they can apply independently

**Key Concept:** The line between helpful learning and academic dishonesty isn't always obvious. We need a framework for making good decisions.

**Important Note:** Adjust this section based on your school's policies and your students' maturity level.

**Activities:**

1. **The Big Question** (2 min)

   Open with honesty:
   - "Using AI for learning can feel like a gray area"
   - "Is it help? Is it cheating? Where's the line?"
   - "There's no universal answer‚Äîbut we can build a framework"
   - "Your school might have policies‚Äîthose come first"

2. **The Learning vs. Shortcutting Test** (4 min)

   Present the decision framework:

   ```
   ASK YOURSELF:

   1. UNDERSTANDING TEST
      ‚úì Can I explain this concept after using AI?
      ‚úó Did I just copy without understanding?

   2. SKILL DEVELOPMENT TEST
      ‚úì Am I building skills I need to learn?
      ‚úó Am I bypassing skills I'm supposed to develop?

   3. ASSIGNMENT PURPOSE TEST
      ‚úì Does AI help me meet the learning objectives?
      ‚úó Does AI let me avoid the intended learning?

   4. INDEPENDENCE TEST
      ‚úì Could I do this without AI after learning with AI?
      ‚úó Will I always need AI for this task?

   5. TRANSPARENCY TEST
      ‚úì Would I be comfortable telling my teacher how I used AI?
      ‚úó Am I hiding my AI use because I know it's wrong?
   ```

   - "If you answer the questions on the right, it's probably crossing the line"
   - "If you answer on the left, you're likely using AI appropriately"

3. **Ethical Scenarios Discussion** (5 min)

   Present scenarios, have students decide:

   **Scenario 1:**
   "You have a math problem set. You solve the first problem yourself but
   get stuck. You use AI to understand the concept, then solve the
   remaining problems independently. Ethical?"

   - Take a poll: Thumbs up (ethical) or down (not ethical)
   - Discuss: This is appropriate learning support ‚úì

   **Scenario 2:**
   "You have an essay due tomorrow. You paste the prompt into AI and ask
   it to write the essay. You read it, make a few small changes, and
   submit it. Ethical?"

   - Poll and discuss: This is academic dishonesty ‚úó
   - Why? You bypassed all the learning the essay was meant to teach

   **Scenario 3:**
   "You're writing an essay and share your draft with AI asking: 'What's
   weak about my argument? What evidence am I missing?' You then research
   those gaps and revise. Ethical?"

   - Poll and discuss: This is appropriate feedback ‚úì
   - Why? You're getting critique and doing the work to improve

   **Scenario 4:**
   "You use AI to explain a history concept, then write your analysis in
   your own words. You don't mention AI anywhere in your paper. Ethical?"

   - Poll and discuss: Gray area‚Äîdepends on school policy
   - Some schools require citation of AI assistance
   - Know your school's rules!

   **Scenario 5:**
   "It's test day. You're stuck on a question and secretly use AI on your
   phone under your desk. Ethical?"

   - Poll and discuss: This is clearly cheating ‚úó
   - Tests measure what YOU know without assistance

4. **When and How to Cite AI Use** (2 min)

   Practical guidelines:
   - "Many schools now require citing AI assistance"
   - "Check your school's policy first"

   Show simple citation format:
   ```
   EXAMPLE CITATIONS:

   In an essay:
   "I used Google Gemini to understand the historical context of [topic]
   and to provide feedback on my draft argument structure. All writing
   and analysis are my own."

   On problem sets:
   "I used AI assistance to understand the concept of [concept] after
   attempting problems 1-3 independently. I then applied this understanding
   to complete the remaining problems without AI."

   General acknowledgment:
   "AI tools (Google Gemini) were used to support my learning and provide
   feedback during the development of this work."
   ```

5. **Your Personal Ethical Guidelines** (2 min)

   Students begin drafting:
   - "Part of your final project: write your personal AI ethics statement"
   - "What are YOUR rules for AI use?"
   - "What will you always do? Never do?"
   - "This becomes your compass going forward"

   Starter questions:
   - What types of assignments will I use AI for?
   - What types will I avoid AI or use minimally?
   - How will I cite AI use?
   - How will I make sure I'm learning, not just completing?

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What's the difference between learning support and academic dishonesty?"
- "How can you tell if you're using AI appropriately?"

**Differentiation:**
- 7th grade: Focus on clear rules and simple scenarios
- 9th grade: Explore gray areas with guidance
- 11th grade: Discuss complex scenarios, encourage sophisticated thinking

**Critical Note:** Know your school's AI policy and emphasize policy compliance throughout this section.
