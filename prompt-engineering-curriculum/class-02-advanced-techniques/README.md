By the end of this class, students will be able to:

1. **Break down** complex problems using multi-step (chain-of-thought) prompting
2. **Apply** few-shot prompting to guide AI with examples
3. **Use** zero-shot vs few-shot strategies appropriately
4. **Implement** negative prompting and constraints effectively
5. **Combine** multiple techniques for sophisticated problem-solving
6. **Leverage** Gemini 2.5's advanced capabilities for academic work

## üéì Key Concepts

### 1. Multi-Step (Chain-of-Thought) Prompting
Breaking complex problems into sequential steps where each step builds on the previous one. Essential for:
- Complex math problems
- Research tasks
- Multi-part assignments
- Analysis requiring multiple perspectives

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting
Providing examples in the prompt to show the AI the pattern you want. According to Google's documentation (Oct 2025), few-shot prompts are **highly recommended** and often more effective than lengthy instructions.

### 3. Zero-Shot Prompting
Prompting without examples, relying on clear instructions alone. Useful when examples are hard to create or when exploring new problem types.

### 4. Negative Prompting
Explicitly telling the AI what NOT to do. Crucial for:
- Maintaining academic integrity
- Avoiding unwanted formats
- Preventing oversimplification
- Keeping responses on-topic

### 5. Prompt Chaining
Connecting multiple prompts where the output of one becomes the input of the next. Powerful for complex, multi-stage tasks.

## üÜï October 2025 Gemini Capabilities

Students will learn to leverage current features:

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: 1 million token context window (can process entire textbooks!)
- **Structured outputs**: Request JSON-formatted responses
- **Long context understanding**: Analyze entire documents, multiple sources
- **Multi-modal capabilities**: Work with text, images together
- **Native image generation**: Create diagrams and visual aids

## üìö Materials Needed

### For Students
- Computer with Gemini 2.5 access
- Homework from Class 1 (to build upon)
- Current multi-step assignments (math, essays, projects)
- Notebook for tracking successful prompts

### For Educators
- Gemini 2.5 Flash or Pro account
- Prepared examples of complex problems
- Student work samples (with permission)
- Comparison examples (zero-shot vs few-shot)

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Minimum Proficiency:**
- Write a multi-step prompt breaking a problem into 3+ steps
- Create a few-shot prompt with 2-3 examples
- Use negative prompting to constrain responses
- Explain when to use each technique

**Target Proficiency:**
- Combine multiple techniques in a single sophisticated prompt
- Choose optimal number of examples for few-shot
- Chain prompts for complex tasks
- Iterate effectively on prompts based on responses

**Advanced Proficiency:**
- Design prompt sequences for multi-stage projects
- Create reusable few-shot templates
- Optimize prompts for specific Gemini models
- Help peers improve their advanced prompts

## üè† Homework Assignment

**"Advanced Techniques in Action"**

Students will:
1. Choose 2 complex problems from different subjects
2. For Problem 1: Use multi-step prompting, document each step
3. For Problem 2: Use few-shot prompting with 3 examples
4. For both: Add appropriate constraints/negative prompts
5. Screenshot/document the full conversation with Gemini
6. Write a reflection on which technique worked better for which problem type

**Estimated Time:** 30-40 minutes

## üí° Teaching Tips

### Engagement Strategies
- Start by showing a complex problem that simple prompts can't solve
- Have students identify when they've needed multi-step thinking
- Build few-shot examples together as a class
- Celebrate creative constraint combinations

### Differentiation

**For 7th Graders:**
- Focus on 2-3 step prompts
- Use 2 examples for few-shot
- Clear, simple constraints
- More scaffolding and templates

**For 9th Graders:**
- 3-5 step prompts
- 2-4 examples for few-shot
- Multiple constraints combined
- Some independent exploration

**For 11th Graders:**
- Complex multi-step sequences
- Optimal example selection
- Sophisticated constraint combinations
- Prompt chaining across conversations

### Common Challenges

**"My multi-step prompt is too long"**
‚Üí Show how to use prompt chaining instead

**"The examples in my few-shot aren't working"**
‚Üí Check for consistent formatting and relevant patterns

**"My constraints are being ignored"**
‚Üí Make them more explicit and place them strategically

**"This is taking too long"**
‚Üí Start simple, add complexity gradually

## üîó Connections

**From Class 1:**
- Builds on role-based prompting
- Extends context engineering
- Applies the four-component structure (R.C.T.F.)

**To Class 3:**
- Multi-step sequences become system instructions
- Few-shot examples become saved templates
- Constraints become model configurations

**To Class 4:**
- All techniques combine in integrated systems
- Templates become personal prompt libraries
- Strategies become sustainable learning workflows

## üé¨ Getting Started

**If you're teaching:**
1. Review lesson-plan.md completely
2. Test all example prompts with current Gemini 2.5 models
3. Prepare comparison demos (simple vs advanced prompts)
4. Have complex homework problems ready from students

**If you're learning independently:**
1. Review Class 1 materials first
2. Work through slides.md to understand concepts
3. Complete exercises in order
4. Apply to your actual complex assignments
