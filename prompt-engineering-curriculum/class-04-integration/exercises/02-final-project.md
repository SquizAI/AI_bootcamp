**Example Documentation:**

```
ASSIGNMENT: Analyze the causes of World War I (5-page essay)

STEP 1: Understanding Requirements
AI Prompt Used: Assignment Analyzer (from library)
"Act as a helpful teacher. I have this assignment: [pasted assignment].
Help me identify: 1) Key requirements, 2) What I need to research,
3) Potential thesis angles. Don't write anything for me—help me plan."

AI Response: [summarized - identified need for multiple causes, different
perspectives, primary sources, clear thesis]

What I Learned: I need to cover political, economic, social causes and
need a clear argument, not just a list of causes.

What I Did Next: Brainstormed 3 potential thesis ideas independently


STEP 2: Research & Context
AI Prompt Used: History Context Researcher (from library)
"You are a history expert. I'm writing about WWI causes. I understand
the assassination of Franz Ferdinand but not the deeper tensions.
Explain: 1) Alliance system, 2) Colonial competition, 3) Militarism.
Use analogies I can understand. Don't write my essay—help me understand."

AI Response: [summarized - great analogies helped me understand the
powder keg metaphor, alliance chains, imperial competition]

What I Learned: The assassination was a trigger, not the cause. Deep
tensions made war likely; the assassination gave an excuse.

What I Did Next: Read two primary sources about alliance tensions,
took notes in my own words

[...continue for all major steps...]

FINAL REFLECTION:
The multi-step prompting and role-based approaches worked incredibly
well for this project. Breaking down the essay into stages (understand,
research, plan, write, revise) and using specific prompts at each stage
kept my work organized and genuine. AI helped me understand complex
historical contexts I was struggling with, but all the analysis and
writing is mine. The constraint "don't write my essay—help me understand"
kept AI in the helper role, not the writer role. Next time, I'd start
with this structured approach from the beginning rather than trying to
do everything at once.

TECHNIQUES USED:
✓ Role-based prompting (history expert, teacher)
✓ Multi-step prompting (broke into stages)
✓ Context engineering (shared my level, confusion points)
✓ Negative prompting (don't write for me)
✓ AI Studio (saved History Helper configuration)
```

### Component 3: Ethical Use Statement (20%)

**Description:**
Articulate your personal guidelines for appropriate, ethical AI use in academic settings.

**Requirements:**
- Clear, specific guidelines (not vague statements)
- Examples of appropriate vs. inappropriate use
- Decision-making framework
- Citation plan
- Reflection on academic integrity

**What to Include:**

**1. Your Decision-Making Framework**

Answer: "How will I decide if AI use is appropriate?"

Example:
```
MY ETHICAL FRAMEWORK

I will ask myself five questions before using AI:

1. UNDERSTANDING TEST
   Will this help me understand or just complete?
   ✓ If understanding → OK to use
   ✗ If just completing → Not appropriate

2. SKILL BUILDING TEST
   Am I developing skills I need or avoiding them?
   ✓ If building → OK to use
   ✗ If avoiding → Not appropriate

3. ASSIGNMENT PURPOSE TEST
   Does AI support or bypass the learning goals?
   ✓ If supports → OK to use
   ✗ If bypasses → Not appropriate

4. INDEPENDENCE TEST
   Could I do this alone after learning with AI?
   ✓ If yes → OK to use
   ✗ If no/always need AI → Not appropriate

5. TRANSPARENCY TEST
   Would I be comfortable telling my teacher?
   ✓ If yes → OK to use
   ✗ If no/hiding it → Not appropriate

If ANY answer is ✗, I reconsider my AI use.
```

**2. Specific Rules for Different Situations**

Create clear boundaries:

```
WHEN I WILL USE AI:

✓ Understanding concepts I'm confused about
✓ Getting feedback on my drafts
✓ Generating practice problems
✓ Checking my work after completing it
✓ Learning background/context information
✓ Explaining why I got something wrong
✓ Creating study guides and outlines
✓ Asking clarifying questions

WHEN I WON'T USE AI:

✗ During tests or quizzes
✗ To write essays or creative work for me
✗ To complete assignments meant to assess MY knowledge
✗ To solve problems I haven't attempted first
✗ When instructions explicitly prohibit it
✗ To bypass learning I'm supposed to be doing
✗ For final work that should show my independent ability
```

**3. Assignment Type Guidelines**

Be specific about different scenarios:

```
ESSAYS & WRITING:
- OK: Help understanding the topic, feedback on my drafts
- NOT OK: AI writing any substantial portion, generating my thesis

PROBLEM SETS:
- OK: Explaining concepts when stuck, checking my completed work
- NOT OK: Solving problems for me, getting answers without attempting

RESEARCH PROJECTS:
- OK: Background research, source suggestions, organization help
- NOT OK: AI doing the research, analysis, or synthesis for me

CREATIVE PROJECTS:
- OK: Brainstorming ideas, technical assistance
- NOT OK: AI creating the core creative content

TESTS & EXAMS:
- OK: Studying and preparing using AI beforehand
- NOT OK: ANY AI use during actual tests
```

**4. Citation Plan**

Explain when and how you'll cite AI:

```
I WILL CITE AI WHEN:
- It significantly helped me understand a concept
- I used it for feedback on major assignments
- I got substantial information or ideas from it
- My school policy requires it
- I'm uncertain if citation is needed (cite to be safe)

MY CITATION FORMAT:
"I used Google Gemini to [specific purpose]. All analysis/writing/work
is my own."

Examples:
- "I used Gemini to understand [concept] and to provide feedback on
  my draft structure. All writing is my own."
- "I used AI assistance to understand [problem type] after attempting
  independently. I then completed remaining problems without AI."
```

**5. Ensuring Genuine Learning**

Explain your checks:

```
HOW I'LL MAKE SURE I'M ACTUALLY LEARNING:

1. Attempt First Rule
   I will always try things independently before using AI

2. Explanation Test
   If I can't explain it in my own words, I haven't learned it yet

3. Independent Application
   After AI helps me understand, I do similar tasks without AI

4. Time Gap Check
   Come back later and see if I still understand without AI

5. Teaching Test
   Can I teach this concept to someone else? If not, more learning needed
```

**6. Personal Commitment**

Write a statement of commitment:

```
MY COMMITMENT TO ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

I commit to using AI as a learning tool, not a shortcut. I understand
that:

- The goal of school is to learn, not just to complete assignments
- AI should enhance my learning, not replace my thinking
- Struggle and effort are essential parts of learning
- My teachers are assessing what I understand, not what AI can do
- Academic dishonesty has serious consequences

I will:
- Follow my school's AI policies
- Ask my teachers when I'm uncertain
- Be transparent about my AI use
- Prioritize genuine learning over grades
- Use AI to become a better learner, not to avoid learning

I will not:
- Submit AI-generated work as my own
- Use AI to bypass learning I'm supposed to do
- Use AI during tests or exams
- Hide AI use when I should disclose it
- Use AI in ways that violate academic integrity

Signed: [Your name]
Date: [Date]
```

**7. Real Scenarios Analysis**

Include 3-5 scenarios with your analysis:

```
SCENARIO 1: Math homework
I have 20 calculus problems. I attempt all of them but am unsure about
my work on 5 problems.

MY DECISION: I will use AI to check those 5 problems and understand
any mistakes. This is appropriate because I attempted first and I'm
using AI to learn from errors.

SCENARIO 2: History essay
I have a major essay due tomorrow that I haven't started.

MY DECISION: I will NOT use AI to write the essay or major portions.
That would be dishonest. I can use AI to help me understand context
quickly, but the analysis and writing must be mine. This is a learning
consequence—I should have started earlier.
