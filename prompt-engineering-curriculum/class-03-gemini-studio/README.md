## Key Concepts

<div>

### What is Gemini AI Studio?

**Gemini AI Studio** is the advanced interface for Google's Gemini AI that provides:

</div>

> **Quick Studio vs. Regular Gemini:**
> - **Regular Gemini** â†’ Quick questions and conversations
> - **AI Studio** â†’ Building reusable systems and advanced applications

</div>

### System Instructions

**System instructions** are special prompts that:
- Apply to **ALL messages** in a conversation
- Define the AI's **persistent role and behavior**
- Set constraints, tone, and approach **upfront**
- Save from repeating context **every time**
- Can be **saved and reused** across multiple chats

Think of system instructions as **"programming" the AI's personality and expertise** for a specific purpose.

### Meta-Prompting

**Meta-prompting** is the practice of using AI to:
- Generate better prompts for specific tasks
- Analyze and improve existing prompts
- Create prompt templates for common scenarios
- Design custom prompt systems for specific needs

This approach uses **AI to improve communication with AI itself** - a powerful meta-skill.

## Important Notes

### Academic Integrity

System instructions and prompt libraries should emphasize **learning, not answer-getting**:

> - Include constraints about not doing work directly
> - Focus on understanding and skill-building
> - Maintain Socratic questioning approaches
> - Document when and how AI assistance was used

This ensures AI is a **learning tool**, not a shortcut.

### Technical Requirements

<div>

- Gemini AI Studio requires a Google account
- Works best on **laptops/tablets** (not phones)
- Stable internet connection needed
- Browser compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Safari recommended

</div>
