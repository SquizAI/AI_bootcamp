**Time Required:** 10-15 minutes
**Purpose:** Check understanding and identify areas for review
**Format:** Create prompts + short reflection

## Part 1: Role-Based Prompting (40 points)

### Task A: Create Three Role-Based Prompts (30 points)

Create one prompt for each scenario below. Each prompt should include:
- A clear, specific role for the AI
- The subject and grade level context
- A specific task or question
- Any constraints on how AI should help

**Scenario 1: Math Help**
You're working on solving systems of equations in Algebra 1 and don't understand the substitution method.

**Your Prompt:**
```
[Write your prompt here]
```

**Scenario 2: History Understanding**
You're studying the causes of World War I for 10th grade history and need to understand how different factors connect.

**Your Prompt:**
```
[Write your prompt here]
```

**Scenario 3: Science Concept**
You're learning about Newton's Laws of Motion in 9th grade physics but keep confusing the three laws.

**Your Prompt:**
```
[Write your prompt here]
```

## Practice Between Classes

Before Class 2, try to:
- [ ] Use role-based prompting for homework in at least 2 different subjects
- [ ] Save 3-5 prompts that worked well for you
- [ ] Help a friend or family member create a role-based prompt
- [ ] Notice what types of roles work best for different subjects
- [ ] Bring examples (or questions) to Class 2

---

## Academic Integrity Reminder

Remember: Use AI to help you **understand and learn**, not to do your work for you.

**Appropriate:**
- "Help me understand this concept by asking me questions"
- "Explain the steps, but let me do the calculations"
- "Show me an example, then let me try one"

**Not Appropriate:**
- "Write my essay for me"
- "Solve all these problems"
- "Give me the answers"

When in doubt, ask yourself: "Am I learning from this, or just getting work done?" If you're not sure, ask your teacher!
