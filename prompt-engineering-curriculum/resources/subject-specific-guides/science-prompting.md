# Science Prompting Guide

## Introduction

This guide will help you use AI effectively for science learning across biology, chemistry, and physics. Great science prompts help you understand concepts, think critically, conduct investigations, and develop scientific reasoning skills. The goal is to enhance your curiosity and deepen your understanding of how the natural world works.

## Core Principles for Science Prompting

1. **Focus on understanding "why" and "how"** - Science is about mechanisms and reasoning
2. **Request explanations at multiple scales** - From molecular to ecosystem levels
3. **Ask for connections between concepts** - Science topics are interconnected
4. **Request real-world applications** - See how science matters in daily life
5. **Emphasize the scientific method** - Learn to think like a scientist
6. **Ask for visual descriptions** - Science concepts often need spatial understanding

## Science-Specific Prompt Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Concept Builder
```
"I'm learning about [concept] in [grade level] [subject]. First, explain it
in simple terms with an everyday analogy. Then explain it using proper
scientific terminology. Finally, show me how this concept connects to
[related concept]."
```

**When to use:** Building foundational understanding of new concepts

### Pattern 2: The Multi-Scale Explainer
```
"Explain [phenomenon] at three levels: what we can observe with our eyes,
what's happening at the cellular/molecular level, and how this connects to
larger systems or patterns in nature."
```

**When to use:** Understanding processes that occur at different scales

### Pattern 3: The Cause-and-Effect Analyzer
```
"For [scientific phenomenon], help me understand: What causes it? What are
the step-by-step mechanisms? What would happen if we changed [variable]?
What are the broader effects or consequences?"
```

**When to use:** Understanding scientific processes and relationships

### Pattern 4: The Scientific Method Guide
```
"I'm designing an experiment to test [hypothesis]. Guide me through:
1. What variables should I control, manipulate, and measure?
2. What materials and procedures make sense?
3. What data should I collect?
4. What results would support or refute my hypothesis?"
```

**When to use:** Planning investigations or understanding experimental design

### Pattern 5: The Misconception Corrector
```
"Many people think [common misconception] about [topic]. Explain why this
is incorrect, what the accurate understanding is, and why the misconception
is so common. Use evidence to support the correct explanation."
```

**When to use:** Addressing common misunderstandings in science

### Pattern 6: The Application Explorer
```
"Explain the science concept of [concept], then show me three different
real-world applications - one in technology, one in medicine/health, and
one in everyday life. How does understanding this concept help in each case?"
```

**When to use:** Connecting abstract concepts to practical applications

## Biology Prompting

### Best Practices:
- Ask for explanations that connect structure to function
- Request diagrams or detailed descriptions of biological structures
- Explore processes step-by-step (cell division, photosynthesis, etc.)
- Connect concepts across levels: molecular, cellular, organism, ecosystem
- Ask about relationships between organisms and their environments

### Topic-Specific Strategies:

**Cell Biology:**
```
"I'm learning about mitochondria. Explain: What is their structure? How does
this structure relate to their function? What would happen to a cell if
mitochondria stopped working? Use the analogy of a power plant, but also
explain where the analogy breaks down."
```

**Genetics:**
```
"Explain how DNA codes for proteins in steps: DNA → RNA → Protein. For each
step, explain what's happening, where in the cell it occurs, and why the
sequence matters. Then explain what would happen if there was a mutation in
the DNA sequence."
```

**Ecology:**
```
"Create a food web for a [specific ecosystem]. Then explain: What would happen
if we removed [specific organism]? How would energy flow change? What about
nutrient cycling? Help me understand both immediate and long-term effects."
```

**Evolution:**
```
"Explain natural selection using a specific example like the peppered moths
during the Industrial Revolution. Walk me through: What was the variation?
What was the selective pressure? How did the population change over time?
What evidence supports this explanation?"
```

**Human Body Systems:**
```
"Explain how the respiratory and circulatory systems work together. Start with
me taking a breath and follow the oxygen molecules: Where do they go? How do
they get there? What cellular process uses them? How does the body coordinate
these two systems?"
```

### Common Biology Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Memorizing without understanding function
- Treating organisms as isolated rather than interconnected
- Confusing correlation with causation in ecological relationships
- Oversimplifying complex biological processes

electrons arranged around an atom? Why does this arrangement matter for how
elements react? Use sodium (Na) as an example and predict how it will behave
chemically based on its electron configuration."
```

**Chemical Bonding:**
```
"Explain the difference between ionic and covalent bonds using: 1) what's
happening at the atomic level, 2) properties of compounds formed by each type,
and 3) real examples of each. Why does table salt (NaCl) dissolve in water
while oil doesn't?"
```

**Chemical Reactions:**
```
"For the reaction between baking soda and vinegar: Explain what's happening
at the molecular level, why bubbles form, what the chemical equation is, and
how this relates to the concept of acids and bases. What type of reaction
is this?"
```

**States of Matter:**
```
"Explain what happens to water molecules during each phase change: solid to
liquid, liquid to gas. What energy changes occur? What happens to molecular
motion? Why does water expand when it freezes, unlike most substances?"
```

**Stoichiometry:**
```
"I need to understand mole ratios in chemical reactions. Start with a simple
reaction like 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O. Explain: What does this equation tell me about
the ratios? If I start with 10 molecules of hydrogen, how much oxygen do I
need? Why do we use moles instead of just counting molecules?"
```

### Common Chemistry Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Confusing atoms with molecules
- Not connecting symbolic equations to actual particle behavior
- Memorizing reaction types without understanding mechanisms
- Ignoring energy changes in reactions

- Ask about extreme cases to test understanding
- Connect concepts to observable phenomena

### Topic-Specific Strategies:

**Motion and Forces:**
```
"Explain Newton's First Law of Motion (inertia) using both everyday examples
and a physics perspective. Why does a ball rolling on grass slow down if
objects in motion stay in motion? What's really happening with the forces?"
```

**Energy:**
```
"I'm learning about energy transformations. Follow the energy through this
scenario: A roller coaster car at the top of the first hill. Explain what
types of energy it has at different points on the track, where energy is
'lost,' and why the second hill can't be higher than the first."
```

**Electricity and Magnetism:**
```
"Explain how an electric circuit works using both the water-flow analogy and
the actual movement of electrons. Where does the analogy help? Where does it
break down? Then explain why a circuit needs to be complete for devices to work."
```

**Waves:**
```
"Compare and contrast sound waves and light waves. What's similar? What's
different? Why can light travel through space but sound can't? Use this to
explain why we see lightning before we hear thunder."
```

**Heat and Temperature:**
```
"Explain the difference between heat and temperature at the molecular level.
Why does a small cup of boiling water have a higher temperature than a swimming
pool, but the pool has more thermal energy? What's actually happening to the
molecules?"
```

### Common Physics Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Treating formulas as recipes without understanding what they represent
- Confusing everyday language with scientific definitions (weight vs. mass)
- Not considering direction in vector quantities
- Ignoring units and their importance
