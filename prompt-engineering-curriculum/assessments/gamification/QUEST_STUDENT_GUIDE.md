║  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ LEGENDARY (13-15 XP)                          ║
║  All components present, sophisticated, would produce    ║
║  amazing results. Nearly flawless execution.             ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  ⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT (10-12 XP)                            ║
║  Most components present, solid understanding, would     ║
║  produce helpful results. Minor improvements possible.   ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  ⭐⭐⭐ GOOD (7-9 XP)                                     ║
║  Some components present, partial understanding, would   ║
║  produce okay results. Several improvements needed.      ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  ⭐⭐ NEEDS WORK (4-6 XP)                                ║
║  Few components present, limited understanding, would    ║
║  produce poor results. Major improvements needed.        ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  ⭐ INCOMPLETE (0-3 XP)                                  ║
║  Missing most components, unclear prompt, would not      ║
║  produce useful results. Needs fundamental rework.       ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Power-Ups (Revision Opportunities)

After each quest, your Guide will offer you a **POWER-UP** - a chance to revise your prompt and earn back up to **+3 bonus XP**!

<div align="center">

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
║   💫 POWER-UP ACTIVATED! 💫          ║
║                                       ║
║   Earn back up to +3 XP!              ║
║   Read feedback → Improve prompt      ║
║   → Resubmit → Gain bonus XP!         ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

</div>

**Should You Use Power-Ups?**

- **YES** if you scored below 12 XP on the quest
- **YES** if you see clear ways to improve after reading feedback
- **YES** if you want to practice the growth mindset
- **MAYBE** if you scored 12+ but see room for mastery

## Tips from Legendary Prompt Engineers

Before you begin, heed these words of wisdom from those who have completed the quest before you:

### From the Archives of Past Heroes:

> **Aria the Context Queen** (Level: Legendary, Score: 98/100)
>
> "My secret? I treat every prompt like I'm talking to a friend who wants to help but doesn't know me yet. I tell them EVERYTHING - what I know, what confuses me, how I learn best. The more context you give, the more personalized the help you get. Don't be vague - be specific!"

> **Marcus the Step Master** (Level: Master, Score: 94/100)
>
> "For multi-step prompts, I learned to number my steps and make each one do something DIFFERENT. Don't just say 'help me understand this' three times. Break it down: Step 1 = identify information, Step 2 = set up the solution, Step 3 = walk through the process. Each step builds on the last."

> **Zara the Constraint Keeper** (Level: Legendary, Score: 99/100)
>
> "I used to forget constraints and get answers that just gave me the solution. Now I ALWAYS include: 'Don't solve this for me - guide me to solve it myself.' That one constraint changed everything. It keeps you learning instead of just copying."

> **Devon the Revision King** (Level: Master, Score: 92/100)
>
> "I failed Quest 1 with a 7/15. I was devastated. But then I read the feedback, used my power-up, improved my prompt, and earned back 3 points to get a 10/15. That taught me more than getting it right the first time. Use those power-ups - they're there to help you learn!"

> **Priya the Capstone Champion** (Level: Legendary, Score: 100/100)
>
> "When I got to Quest 7, I didn't just throw all the techniques together randomly. I thought: What do I REALLY need help with? Then I strategically picked techniques that would work together. My capstone prompt was about chemistry, and I combined role + context + multi-step + constraints because those made sense together. Be strategic!"

### Universal Success Strategies

<div align="center">

| Strategy | Key Principle |
|:---------|:--------------|
| **Read Feedback Like Treasure Maps** | Your Guide gives specific, actionable feedback after each quest. Don't just look at your score - READ THE WORDS! |
| **Use R.C.T.F. as Your Compass** | Role, Context, Task, Format - this framework saves you every time. Before submitting, ask: "Did I include all four?" |
| **Base Prompts on REAL Schoolwork** | Don't make up fake scenarios. Use actual classes, actual confusion, actual assignments. This makes prompts authentic AND helps you learn real skills. |
| **Specificity is Your Superpower** | "Help me with math" = weak. "Help me understand why we multiply by the reciprocal when dividing fractions" = powerful. The more specific, the better the help. |
| **Maintain Academic Integrity Always** | Ask for guidance, not answers. Request to be walked through, not given solutions. Your constraint should keep you learning. |
| **Don't Rush - Quality Over Speed** | Fast students finish in 35-45 minutes. Thoughtful students take 60-75 minutes. Both can earn legendary status. What matters is the QUALITY of your prompts. |
| **Level Up Your Game with Each Quest** | Your prompts should get better as you go. Quest 1 might be rough - that's okay. By Quest 7, you should be combining everything. Show PROGRESSION. |
| **The Capstone is Your Moment of Glory** | Quest 7 is worth the same XP as others, but it's different. It's your chance to show mastery. Combine techniques STRATEGICALLY, not randomly. |

## Technical Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- **Device:** Computer, tablet, or phone
- **Browser:** Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge (updated version)
- **Internet:** Stable connection (assessment requires continuous AI access)
- **Account:** Free Google account for Gemini access
- **Time:** 45-75 uninterrupted minutes

### Recommended Setup

- **Screen Size:** Larger screens make it easier to read prompts and feedback
- **Dual Screens:** One for Gemini, one for notes (if available)
- **Quiet Environment:** Minimize distractions
- **Full Battery:** Or stay plugged in
- **Notes Open:** Have your R.C.T.F. framework visible

### What to Do If...

**Gemini is down or not loading:**

- Check status at status.google.com
- Try different browser
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Contact your teacher for alternate timing

**I lose my connection mid-quest:**

- Don't panic! Gemini should save your conversation
- Refresh the page
- Scroll up to see your progress
- Continue from where you left off
- If lost completely, contact teacher (you may get an extension)

**The meta-prompt doesn't work:**

- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE thing (it's very long)
- Check you got both the starting ``` and ending ```
- Try pasting into a new Gemini conversation
- If still broken, tell your teacher (might be an update issue)

**I can't save my conversation:**

- **Screenshot option:** Use your device's screenshot tool (varies by device)
- **Copy/paste option:** Scroll to top, select all text, copy into Google Doc
- **Last resort:** Write down your scores and key prompts manually (not ideal but better than nothing)

## Time Estimates & Pacing

### Quest Duration Breakdown

**TOTAL TIME: 45-75 minutes**

Breaking it down by quest:

| Quest | Duration | Notes |
|:------|:--------:|:------|
| Quest 1 | 5-8 min | Introduction + first prompt |
| Quest 2 | 6-10 min | Context requires detail |
| Quest 3 | 7-10 min | Steps take thought |
| Quest 4 | 8-12 min | Examples take time |
| Quest 5 | 6-10 min | Constraints require strategy |
| Quest 6 | 10-15 min | TWO prompts - creative AND analytical |
| Quest 7 | 10-15 min | Capstone - your masterpiece! |
| Final Report | 3-5 min | Reading your results |
| **BONUS** | +5-10 min | If using power-ups (revisions) |

### Pacing Strategies

**🐢 The Thoughtful Strategist (60-75 minutes)**

- Takes time to draft prompts before submitting
- Uses most power-up opportunities
- Reads all feedback thoroughly
- Results: Usually high quality, good scores

**🐇 The Confident Speedster (35-50 minutes)**

- Writes prompts quickly and confidently
- Uses few power-ups (gets it right first time)
- Still reads feedback but doesn't need revisions
- Results: Can earn high scores if skilled

**🦊 The Balanced Adventurer (45-60 minutes)** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

- Takes enough time to be thoughtful
- Uses power-ups strategically (on lower-scoring quests)
- Balances speed with quality
- Results: Best approach for most students

### Time Management Tips

**Front-Load Your Time:**

- Quests 1-3 are foundational - don't rush these
- Build strong habits early
- Quality on early quests sets the tone

**Budget Extra Time for Quest 7:**

- This is your capstone - your masterpiece
- Worth spending 10-15 minutes here
- Combine everything you've learned

**Use Power-Ups Wisely:**

- Quick revision for Quest 1 = good investment
- Rushed revision on Quest 7 = less effective
- Better to revise early quests than rush later ones

**If Running Out of Time:**

- FINISH all 7 quests (even if rushed)
- Better to complete with decent prompts than perfect 6 and skip Quest 7
- Your teacher sees completion as important

**If You Have Extra Time:**

- Use power-ups to boost your lowest-scoring quests
- Reread your capstone prompt and polish it
- Review your final report carefully
