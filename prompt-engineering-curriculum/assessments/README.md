## Key Assessment Moments

### Formative Assessment (Learning Checkpoints)
- **In-class practice:** Self-assessment-rubric.md
- **Class 1 homework:** Did students write prompts with all components?
- **Class 2 homework:** Did students use advanced techniques?
- **Class 3 homework:** Did students set up AI Studio effectively?

### Summative Assessment (Big Picture)
- **Class 1 exit ticket:** Can you write a complete role-based prompt?
- **Class 2 exit ticket:** Can you combine multiple techniques?
- **Class 3 exit ticket:** Can you use AI Studio effectively?
- **Class 4 project:** Comprehensive demonstration of mastery

## Differentiation

### For Struggling Students
- Use self-assessment-rubric.md with fewer criteria initially
- Focus on one technique at a time (single class)
- Provide sentence starters for reflection
- Pair with successful prompts for modeling
- Celebrate small improvements

### For Advanced Students
- Use project-rubric.md to guide independent projects
- Challenge to teach others using skill-checklist.md
- Encourage meta-analysis of their own technique choices
- Suggest exploring advanced AI Studio features
- Support them in creating templates for classmates

### For Different Subjects
- Customize examples in all rubrics for student subjects
- Skill-checklist.md already notes subject-specific applications
- Self-assessment-rubric.md includes subject guidance
- Project-rubric.md encourages multiple subjects

## Grade-Free or Graded Options

### Fully Formative (No Grades)
- All three tools used for learning only
- Self-assessment-rubric.md is strictly reflective
- Skill-checklist.md is a growth tracking tool
- Project is a learning demonstration (scored on rubric as feedback only)
- Best for: Younger students, growth-focused classrooms

### Hybrid (Some Assessment, Light Grades)
- Self-assessment-rubric.md is formative
- Skill-checklist.md tracks growth for discussion
- Project is graded using Advanced/Proficient scale only
- Best for: Middle school, skill-focused contexts

### Traditional Grading (Full Assessment)
- All three tools contribute to grading
- Self-assessment used to show learning process
- Skill-checklist shows skill acquisition
- Project scored using full rubric with A-F scale
- Best for: High school, contexts requiring grades

## Implementation Tips

### First Time Using These Tools
1. Read through all three before class
2. Share self-assessment-rubric.md with students after Class 1
3. Let students practice self-assessment multiple times
4. Share skill-checklist.md section by section (Class 1 section after Class 1)
5. Introduce project-rubric.md early in Class 3

### Making It Student-Centered
- Have students score sample prompts first (practice)
- Students self-score before showing teacher/peer
- Class discussions: "Why would you score this as Proficient vs. Advanced?"
- Peer scoring: "Where would you score your partner's prompt?"
- Student-led conferences: "Here's my growth in [skill area]"

### Making It Sustainable
- Use the same rubrics across all 4 classes (consistency helps)
- Build self-assessment into normal class routine
- Have students keep portfolios of their prompts
- Reference rubrics in all feedback you give
- Let students drive the assessment conversation

## Research Support

These assessments align with:
- **Authentic Assessment Theory:** Real-world application, student choice, reflection
- **Growth Mindset Research:** Emphasis on improvement, learning process, effort

## Questions & Troubleshooting

**"Students are struggling with self-assessment."**
→ Start simpler. Have students score three sample prompts first. Discuss why you'd score them a certain way. Then have them try their own.

**"It's taking too long to assess."**
→ Use self-assessment-rubric.md primarily (students do most work). Use project-rubric.md only for final project. Use skill-checklist.md as quick checkpoints.

**"How do I use these with mixed grades?"**
→ All three tools are adaptable. Adjust examples and complexity of expectations. Core concepts work for grades 6-12.

**"Can I combine these with other assessments?"**
→ Absolutely. These tools can coexist with other assessments. They're especially strong for formative assessment and authentic projects.

**"Should every prompt be graded?"**
→ No. Use self-assessment-rubric.md for practice (formative). Use project-rubric.md only for final projects (summative). This balances accountability with learning.

## Teaching with These Assessments

Remember:
- **Transparency:** Students know how they're being assessed
- **Fairness:** Clear criteria apply to everyone
- **Growth:** Focus on improvement, not perfection
- **Authenticity:** Based on real work
- **Feedback:** Assessment provides learning guidance
- **Agency:** Students drive self-assessment

**The goal is learning, not grading. Use these tools to help students learn prompt engineering deeply and apply it to their real academic work.**

## Final Thought

These assessment tools are designed to shift the focus from "Did you get it right?" to "Can you see how you're getting better?" That subtle shift makes all the difference in helping students develop a growth mindset about their learning.

Your students are learning a skill that will serve them across all their subjects, throughout their education, and into their careers. These tools help make that learning visible and meaningful.

**Good luck. We can't wait to see what your students create.**
