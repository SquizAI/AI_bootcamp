### Section 1: Technical Skills

#### Role-Based Prompting

**How often do I use role-based prompting?**
☐ Almost never
☐ Sometimes (less than half my prompts)
☐ Often (more than half my prompts)
☐ Almost always
☐ Always—it's automatic now

**How specific are my roles?**
☐ Very generic (just "teacher" or "expert")
☐ Somewhat specific (e.g., "math teacher")
☐ Pretty specific (e.g., "patient algebra tutor")
☐ Very specific (e.g., "patient algebra tutor who uses real-world examples")
☐ Highly tailored to my exact needs

**Can I explain why I choose specific roles?**
☐ No, I just guess
☐ Sometimes I can explain
☐ Usually I have a reason
☐ Always—I understand what different roles provide
☐ I can teach others how to select roles

**Example of my best role-based prompt:**
```
[Paste an example here]
```

**Why it works:**
```
[Explain briefly]
```

#### Context Engineering

**How much context do I typically provide?**
☐ Little to none
☐ Just my grade level
☐ Grade level and subject
☐ Grade level, subject, and what I understand/don't understand
☐ Comprehensive context including learning preferences and specific needs

**Is my context helpful and relevant?**
☐ Not sure / don't include much context
☐ Sometimes helpful
☐ Usually helpful
☐ Very helpful—AI responses show it understands my needs
☐ Always helpful—I know exactly what context improves responses

**Do I anticipate what information AI needs?**
☐ No, I often need to add context after first response
☐ Sometimes I include enough
☐ Usually I include what's needed
☐ Almost always—I rarely need to clarify
☐ Yes—I've learned what context works for different situations

**Example of my best contextualized prompt:**
```
[Paste an example here]
```

**What context made it effective:**
```
[Explain briefly]
```

#### Multi-Step Prompting

**Are my steps logical and sequential?**
☐ Don't usually create steps
☐ My steps sometimes don't connect well
☐ My steps usually make sense
☐ My steps build on each other logically
☐ My steps are strategic and efficient

**Do I build on previous responses?**
☐ Each prompt is independent
☐ Sometimes I reference earlier responses
☐ Usually my steps connect
☐ Always—each step uses information from the previous
☐ I create sophisticated multi-step sequences

**Example of my best multi-step sequence:**
```
Step 1: [Paste]
Step 2: [Paste]
Step 3: [Paste]
```

**Why this sequence worked:**
```
[Explain briefly]
```

#### Few-Shot Prompting

**Do I use examples to guide AI responses?**

```

#### Constraints & Negative Prompting

**Do I include constraints to guide AI?**
☐ No, I just ask for what I want
☐ Sometimes I say "don't give me the answer"
☐ Often I include "don't" instructions

☐ Usually they help AI give better responses
☐ They consistently prevent unwanted responses
☐ They're perfectly calibrated for my learning needs

**Do my constraints maintain learning focus?**
☐ Not applicable—I don't use constraints
☐ Sometimes, but AI still gives too much
☐ Usually they keep AI from just giving answers
☐ They effectively maintain my learning
☐ They create the perfect balance of guidance and independence

**Example of effective constraint use:**

☐ Usually get it right in 1-2 tries now

**Do I improve with each iteration?**
☐ My changes don't usually help much

## Getting Unstuck

If you're struggling with self-assessment:

### "I don't know how to rate myself"

Think about:
- Can you do it without help?
- Could you teach someone else?
- Do you use it regularly?
- Are you getting better results over time?

### "I feel like I'm not improving"

Look for:
- Small wins in specific skills
- Subjects where it's working better
- Moments when prompting helped
- Compare to your earliest prompts

### "I'm not sure what's working"

Try:
- Keep a log for one week
- Note which prompts get good responses
- Track which techniques you use most
- Ask a peer or teacher for observations

### "I want to improve but don't know how"

Strategies:
- Focus on one skill at a time
- Review examples from class
- Practice with low-stakes homework
- Ask for specific feedback
- Find a practice buddy
