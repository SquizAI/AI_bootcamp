## Key Concepts

### 1. Prompt Engineering

<div style="background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #6366F1; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**The practice of crafting effective instructions for AI tools to get useful, accurate, and helpful responses.** This involves learning how to structure questions and requests for optimal results.

</div>

### 2. Role-Based Prompting

<div style="background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #6366F1; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**Assigning the AI a specific expert role to guide its responses:**

- "Act as a math teacher..."
- "You are a history expert..."
- "Pretend you're a writing tutor..."

</div>

### 3. Context Engineering

<div style="background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #6366F1; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**Providing the AI with relevant background information about:**

- Current level of understanding
- Previously learned material
- Specific assistance needed
- Subject and grade level

</div>

### 4. The Four Components of Effective Prompts

<div align="center">

| Component | Description | Example |
|:---:|---|---|
| **Role** | Who should the AI be? | "Act as a high school tutor" |
| **Context** | What background does the AI need? | "I'm in 9th grade learning algebra" |
| **Task** | What exactly do you want the AI to do? | "Explain linear equations step-by-step" |
| **Format** | How should the response be structured? | "Use simple language with examples" |

</div>
