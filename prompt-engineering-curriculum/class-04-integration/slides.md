## Integration in Action

### Example Prompt Analysis

```
You are an expert chemistry tutor working with a high school student.

I'm studying chemical equilibrium and understand Le Chatelier's
principle in theory, but I'm struggling to apply it to real problems.
I tend to get confused about which direction the equilibrium shifts.

Here's an example of how I want you to help:
Problem: "If we increase the pressure..."
Your response: "Let me think through this step by step. First, what
happens to the number of molecules when pressure increases?..."

Now help me with this problem: If we add more reactant A to the
system A + B ⇌ C + D, which direction does equilibrium shift?

Don't just tell me the answer—guide me to figure it out. Use
questions and step-by-step reasoning.
```

### Techniques Used:
- Role-based prompting
- Context engineering
- Few-shot example
- Multi-step structure
- Constraints/negative prompting

**This is integration:** Multiple techniques working together seamlessly

## Library + AI Studio Integration

### Save Your Best Configurations

**In AI Studio:**
1. Create chat with system instructions
2. Name it clearly (e.g., "Math Tutor - Concepts")
3. Use it whenever you need that type of help

**Example System Instruction:**
```
You are a patient, encouraging math tutor. When I ask for help:
1. Never give me the answer directly
2. Ask me questions to guide my thinking
3. Check my understanding at each step
4. Use real-world examples and analogies
5. Celebrate when I figure things out

I'm a visual learner, so use descriptions I can picture.
```

### Connection
- Library entries become system instructions
- Best prompts become saved chats
- One system, multiple access points

---

## Library Growth Strategy

### Start Small
- 10-15 core prompts today
- Your most common needs

### Add Over Time
- When you create a great prompt, save it
- Refine prompts that almost work
- Delete ones that don't help

### It's Personal
- Your library reflects YOUR learning style
- No two libraries will be identical
- That's perfect

---

## Part 2: Sustainable Learning Workflows

---

## What is a Learning Workflow?

**Definition:**
A repeatable step-by-step process for common academic tasks

**Benefits:**

- You need a framework for making good decisions

**Approach:**
- Develop decision-making tools
- Discuss real scenarios
- Create your personal guidelines

**Important:**
- Your school's policy comes FIRST
- These are frameworks, not universal rules
- When in doubt, ask your teacher

---

## The Learning vs. Shortcutting Test

### Five Critical Questions

**1. UNDERSTANDING TEST**
- ✓ Can I explain this concept after using AI?
- ✗ Did I just copy without understanding?

**2. SKILL DEVELOPMENT TEST**
- ✓ Am I building skills I need to learn?
- ✗ Am I bypassing skills I'm supposed to develop?

**3. ASSIGNMENT PURPOSE TEST**
- ✓ Does AI help me meet the learning objectives?
- ✗ Does AI let me avoid the intended learning?

**4. INDEPENDENCE TEST**
- ✓ Could I do this without AI after learning with AI?
- ✗ Will I always need AI for this task?

**5. TRANSPARENCY TEST**
- ✓ Would I be comfortable telling my teacher how I used AI?
- ✗ Am I hiding my AI use because I know it's wrong?

**Rule of Thumb:**
- Green checks = Appropriate learning support
- Red X's = Crossing the line into dishonesty

---

## Ethical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Math Problem Set (APPROPRIATE)

**Situation:**
You have 10 math problems. You solve the first one yourself but get stuck. You use AI to understand the concept, then solve the remaining 9 problems independently.

**Analysis:** ✓ APPROPRIATE

**Why?**
- Attempted independently first
- Used AI to understand, not to solve
- Applied learning independently
- Built genuine skills
- Could explain your work

---

### Scenario 2: Essay Writing (NOT APPROPRIATE)

**Situation:**
You paste the essay prompt into AI and ask it to write the essay. You read it, make a few small changes, and submit it as your work.

**Analysis:** ✗ NOT APPROPRIATE

**Why?**
- Bypassed all the learning
- Didn't develop writing skills
- Can't explain the thinking
- Avoided assignment's purpose
- This is plagiarism

---

### Scenario 3: Essay Feedback (APPROPRIATE)

**Situation:**
You write your essay draft yourself. You share it with AI asking: "What's weak about my argument? What evidence am I missing?" You then research those gaps and revise your work yourself.

**Analysis:** ✓ APPROPRIATE

**Why?**
- You wrote the original work
- Using AI like a writing tutor
- Still doing the revision work
- Developing critical thinking
- Could cite AI feedback

---

### Scenario 4: Test Time (NOT APPROPRIATE)

**Situation:**
It's test day. You're stuck on a question. You secretly use AI on your phone under your desk to help you answer it.

**Analysis:** ✗ DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE

**Why?**
- This is clearly cheating
- Tests measure what YOU know
- No assistance allowed
- Violates test conditions
- Could result in serious consequences

---

## When and How to Cite AI Use

### Know Your School's Policy

**Some schools require:**
- Citation for any AI use
- Disclosure on major assignments
- Specific citation formats

**Some schools allow:**
- Learning assistance without citation
- Feedback tools uncited
- Concept explanation uncited

**Best Practice:**
- Ask your teacher when unclear
- Over-communicate rather than hide
- Be transparent about your process

---

## Citation Examples

### In an Essay
```
"I used Google Gemini to understand the historical context
of the French Revolution and to provide feedback on my draft
argument structure. All writing and analysis are my own."
```

### On Problem Sets
```
"I used AI assistance to understand the concept of derivatives
after attempting problems 1-3 independently. I then applied
this understanding to complete the remaining problems without
AI assistance."
```

### General Acknowledgment
```
"AI tools (Google Gemini) were used to support my learning
and provide feedback during the development of this work.
All final ideas, analysis, and writing are my own."
```

## Your Personal Ethical Guidelines

### Draft Your Own Rules

**1. What will I ALWAYS do?**
- Attempt work independently first?
- Use AI only after getting stuck?
- Cite when required?
- Focus on understanding, not just answers?

**2. What will I NEVER do?**
- Submit AI-written work as my own?
- Use AI during tests?
- Copy without understanding?
- Hide AI use when I should disclose?

**3. What types of assignments?**
- Where is AI most appropriate?
- Where should I avoid AI?
- Where is AI somewhere in between?

**4. How will I cite?**
- What citation format?
- When will I disclose use?
- How will I document my process?

**5. How will I ensure genuine learning?**
- What checks will I use?
- How will I verify understanding?
- What independence tests?

## The Golden Rule of AI Use

**"Am I learning or am I shortcutting?"**

**If AI helps you understand → Appropriate**
**If AI does your thinking → Inappropriate**

**You are the learner. AI is the tool.**
