## Example 1: 7th Grade Math - Fractions

### Student's Situation
Learning fractions, confused about why you multiply by the reciprocal when dividing

### The Prompt
```
Act as a patient math teacher for 7th graders who uses real-world examples.
I'm learning about dividing fractions. I know how to do it—you flip the
second fraction and multiply. But I don't understand WHY you flip it.
It seems like a random trick. Can you explain why this works using
something from real life, like pizza or sharing things?
```

### What Gemini Provided
A clear explanation using pizza slices as an analogy, showing why "dividing by a fraction" is the same as "multiplying by its reciprocal"

### Why It Worked
- **Role specified teaching style** (patient, uses real-world examples)
- **Clear context** (grade level, what they know how to do)
- **Precise confusion** (understands procedure, not concept)
- **Requested format** (real-world analogy, suggested pizza)

### Student's Reflection
> "The pizza example made it click! I finally get why you flip it instead of just memorizing the rule."

## Example 2: 9th Grade English - Essay Thesis

### Student's Situation
Writing literary analysis essay, thesis statement too vague

### The Prompt
```
Act as an English teacher who helps with essay writing. I'm writing a
5-paragraph literary analysis of To Kill a Mockingbird for 9th grade English.
My current thesis is: "Scout learns important lessons throughout the book."
My teacher said this is too vague and I need to be more specific. Can you
explain what makes a thesis statement specific vs. vague, and help me figure
out how to make mine more specific without just rewriting it for me?
```

### What Gemini Provided
- Explanation of specific vs. vague thesis statements
- Questions to help the student identify WHAT lessons and WHY they matter
- Framework for strengthening the thesis
- Examples of progression from vague to specific

### Why It Worked
- **Specific assignment context** (type of essay, book, grade)
- **Included current work** (showed the vague thesis)
- **Explained the feedback** (teacher said it's too vague)
- **Important constraint** ("without just rewriting it for me")
- **Asked for framework** (how to improve, not just an answer)

### Student's Reflection
> "The questions helped me figure out what I actually wanted to say. I rewrote my thesis myself and it's way better!"

## Example 3: 11th Grade Chemistry - Balancing Equations

### Student's Situation
Understands what balanced equations are, but can't figure out the strategy for balancing them

### The Prompt
```
Act as a chemistry tutor who explains thinking processes. I'm in 11th grade
chemistry and I'm stuck on balancing chemical equations. I understand WHAT
a balanced equation is—same number of each atom on both sides. I can check
if an equation is balanced. But when I try to balance one myself, I just
randomly try numbers until something works. There must be a better strategy.
Can you walk me through your thinking process when you balance an equation?
Like, what do you look at first, second, third? Give me a method, not just
examples.
```

### What Gemini Provided
- Step-by-step systematic approach to balancing equations
- Order of operations (what to balance first, second, etc.)
- Tips for recognizing polyatomic ions
- A flowchart-like strategy
- Then an example applying the strategy

### Why It Worked
- **Specified what they DO understand** (concept and checking)
- **Identified the real problem** (strategy, not understanding)
- **Asked for thinking process** (not just examples)
- **Requested method explicitly** ("give me a method")
- **Made the need clear** (currently using trial and error)

### Student's Reflection
> "Game changer! I was wasting so much time before. Now I have a system and it's so much faster."

## Example 4: 8th Grade History - Comparing Civilizations

### Student's Situation
Project comparing ancient Greece and Rome, not sure what aspects to compare

### The Prompt
```
Act as a middle school history teacher. I'm doing a project comparing ancient
Greece and ancient Rome. I have to create a presentation showing similarities
and differences. I've researched both civilizations and have lots of notes,
but I don't know how to organize them—what categories should I compare them in?
My teacher mentioned government, culture, and military, but I'm not sure what
else historians look at or why those categories matter. Can you give me a
list of 5-6 important categories for comparing civilizations, with a brief
explanation of why each category helps us understand the civilization better?
```

### What Gemini Provided
- Six key categories for comparison (government, economy, military, culture, technology, social structure)
- Brief explanation of why each matters
- Guiding questions for each category
- Tips on finding the most interesting comparisons

### Why It Worked
- **Showed preparation** (already researched, has notes)
- **Identified specific need** (organization, not information)
- **Acknowledged teacher's guidance** (mentioned some categories)
- **Asked for reasoning** (why categories matter)
- **Requested structure** (list with explanations)

### Student's Reflection
> "This helped me organize all my random notes into something that makes sense. My presentation has a clear structure now."

## Example 5: 10th Grade Biology - Photosynthesis vs. Respiration

### Student's Situation
Constantly mixing up photosynthesis and cellular respiration

### The Prompt
```
Act as a biology teacher who's good at helping students remember things.
I'm in 10th grade and I keep mixing up photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
I sort of understand each one separately, but when I try to remember which is
which on tests, I get them backwards. I know photosynthesis is in plants and
respiration is in animals, but then I learned plants do respiration too and
now I'm even more confused. Can you explain the relationship between them in
a way that helps me keep them straight, and maybe give me a memory trick or
comparison chart I can remember during tests?
```

### What Gemini Provided
- Clear explanation of the relationship (they're opposite/complementary processes)
- Simple comparison chart
- Memory tricks (several options to choose from)
- Explanation of why plants do both
- How to remember which is which

### Why It Worked
- **Identified the problem** (mixing them up, not lack of understanding)
- **Acknowledged partial knowledge** (understands each separately)
- **Specific context** (happens on tests)
- **Showed the confusion point** (plants doing respiration too)
- **Requested practical tools** (memory trick, comparison chart)

### Student's Reflection
> "The memory trick 'Plants Make Fuel' (photosynthesis makes glucose fuel) vs 'Breathing Burns Fuel' (respiration uses fuel) finally made it stick!"

## Example 6: 7th Grade Science - Hypothesis Writing

### Student's Situation
Science fair project, doesn't understand what makes a good hypothesis

### The Prompt
```
Act as a science teacher helping with a science fair project. I'm in 7th grade
and I'm doing a project about which type of music helps plants grow better.
I need to write a hypothesis but I don't really get what that means. My teacher
showed examples but they all sound like guesses to me. What makes a hypothesis
different from just a guess? And how do I write one for my project? Can you
explain what a hypothesis is, then help me understand what I need to think
about to write a good one for my specific project?
```

### What Gemini Provided
- Definition of hypothesis vs. regular guess (educated guess based on research)
- Components of a good hypothesis
- Examples from the student's specific project
- Questions to help the student develop their own hypothesis
- Format/structure for writing it

### Why It Worked
- **Specific assignment** (science fair)
- **Specific project topic** (music and plant growth)
- **Identified confusion** (hypothesis vs. guess)
- **Referenced attempt to understand** (saw examples, still confused)
- **Requested scaffolding** (explain concept, then help apply)

### Student's Reflection
> "I didn't realize I needed to research first! I thought you just guessed. Now I understand what I'm supposed to do."

## Example 7: 11th Grade Math - Word Problems

### Student's Situation
Can do algebra, but can't translate word problems into equations

### The Prompt
```
Act as a math tutor who specializes in word problems. I'm in 11th grade
algebra 2 and I can solve equations easily once they're written out. My
problem is reading a word problem and figuring out what equation to write.
I don't know which information matters, what the variable should represent,
or how to set it up. Can you teach me a process for approaching word problems—
like a checklist or steps I should follow every time? Then show me an example
working through your process step by step.
```

### What Gemini Provided
- A systematic 5-step process for word problems
- Checklist of what to identify
- Complete worked example following the process
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Practice problem to try using the process

### Why It Worked
- **Distinguished competency** (can solve equations) from difficulty (translation)
- **Specific about the struggle** (which info matters, what variable represents, setup)
- **Requested transferable tool** (process or checklist)
- **Asked for modeling** (example working through the process)
- **Reusable strategy** (something to use every time)

### Student's Reflection
> "The checklist is amazing. I use it for every word problem now. It takes the guesswork out of where to start."

## Example 8: 9th Grade History - Cause and Effect

### Student's Situation
Essay on causes of WWI, knows the assassination but teacher wants "deeper causes"

### The Prompt
```
Act as a history teacher for 9th graders. I'm writing an essay on the causes
of World War I. I know about the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
but my teacher says that's the "spark" not the "underlying causes," and I
need to write about the deeper causes. I'm not sure what makes a cause "deep"
vs. a "spark," or how to find these deeper causes in my textbook. Can you
explain what historians mean by underlying causes vs. immediate causes, and
help me understand what kinds of things I should be looking for when I
research the deeper causes of WWI?
```

### What Gemini Provided
- Clear distinction between immediate triggers and underlying causes
- Analogy (spark vs. kindling and fuel)
- Categories of underlying causes to look for (political tensions, alliances, economic factors, etc.)
- Specific examples from WWI
- Questions to ask when evaluating if something is an underlying cause

### Why It Worked
- **Included teacher's feedback** ("spark" vs "underlying causes")
- **Asked about the concept** (what makes causes "deep")
- **Practical research need** (what to look for in textbook)
- **Two-part request** (explain concept, then how to apply)
- **Specific to assignment** (WWI essay context)

### Student's Reflection
> "The spark vs. fuel analogy made it click. Now I understand what my teacher means and I found lots of underlying causes in my textbook."

## Example 9: 8th Grade Math - Negative Numbers

### Student's Situation
Multiplying and dividing negative numbers, keeps making sign errors

### The Prompt
```
Act as a patient middle school math teacher. I'm in 8th grade and I keep
making mistakes with positive and negative numbers when I multiply or divide.
I know the rules (two negatives make a positive, etc.) but on tests when I'm
working fast, I mess up the signs. I need something better than just memorizing
the rules—like an understanding of WHY negative times negative equals positive,
or a trick that helps me remember in the moment. Can you explain the reasoning
behind the rules so they make sense instead of just being rules I have to memorize?
```

### What Gemini Provided
- Conceptual explanation using number line and direction
- Analogy (double negatives in language)
- Visual representation description
- The "why" behind each rule
- A quick reference method for tests

### Why It Worked
- **Problem context** (makes mistakes on tests when working fast)
- **Acknowledged current approach** (memorizing rules)
- **Requested deeper understanding** ("why" not just "what")
- **Specific need** (something that works "in the moment")
- **Clear about what doesn't work** (memorization alone)

### Student's Reflection
> "The number line explanation finally made sense! Now I can figure out the sign if I forget the rule instead of just guessing."

## Example 10: 10th Grade English - MLA Citations

### Student's Situation
Research paper, confused about MLA format for citations

### The Prompt
```
Act as an English teacher helping with research paper formatting. I'm a 10th
grader writing a research paper and I need to cite my sources in MLA format.
I have the MLA guide my teacher gave us, but it's confusing because there are
so many different rules for different types of sources. I'm using: 2 websites,
1 book, and 1 database article. Can you explain the pattern or logic behind
MLA citations so I understand what information goes where and why, rather than
just showing me the formats? Then give me the specific formats I need for my
four sources.
```

### What Gemini Provided
- Explanation of the logic behind MLA structure (author-page system, alphabetical, etc.)
- General pattern (author, title, container, publisher, date, location)
- How the pattern adapts for different source types
- Specific formats for the four sources the student has
- Tips for keeping track of citation info

### Why It Worked
- **Specific assignment** (research paper, MLA)
- **Acknowledged resources** (has MLA guide but it's confusing)
- **Identified problem** (too many different rules)
- **Listed specific sources** (so help is relevant)
- **Asked for understanding** (the logic, not just formats)
- **Also requested practical** (the specific formats needed)

### Student's Reflection
> "Understanding the pattern makes SO much sense. Now I can figure out how to cite anything, not just the four I asked about."

**Specify the Type of Help:**
- First attempt: "Help with my essay"
- Revision: Specified which part of essay and what kind of help

**Request Format:**
- First attempt: Ended with just a question
- Revision: Added "using examples" or "step-by-step"

**Include Constraints:**
- First attempt: Just asked for help
- Revision: Added "without giving me the answer" or "don't write it for me"

**Get More Specific About Confusion:**
- First attempt: "I don't get it"
- Revision: "I understand X but not Y"

**Remember: Iteration is normal and good!**

## Tips from Students

### Real advice from students who've mastered prompting:

**"Be specific about what you already know so you don't get explanations that are too basic."** - 9th grader

**"If the first response isn't quite right, just tell the AI what to adjust. Don't give up!"** - 11th grader

**"Save your good prompts! I have a doc of prompts that work well for me and I reuse them."** - 10th grader

**"Don't be embarrassed about what you don't know. The more honest you are, the better help you get."** - 7th grader

**"Ask for what would actually help you, not what you think you're supposed to ask for."** - 8th grader

**"The 'without doing it for me' part is really important. Otherwise you don't actually learn."** - 11th grader

**"I always mention my grade level now because I noticed responses are way better when I do."** - 9th grader

**"If you're completely lost, say that! AI can help you find your starting point."** - 8th grader
