---

### Solid at Advanced Techniques

You can consistently:
- Choose when to use multi-step prompting vs. single prompts
- Create effective few-shot examples that pattern-match correctly
- Include meaningful constraints that protect your learning
- Combine techniques appropriately without overcomplicating
- Recognize when you've optimized the prompt well enough

---

### Solid at AI Studio

You can:
- Navigate AI Studio confidently without getting lost

- Use meta-prompting to improve your own prompts
- Maintain an organized prompt library you actually use
- Switch between projects for different purposes

---

### Solid at Integration

- Build sustainable personal systems you maintain

---

<div align="center">

## Common Challenge Areas

</div>

Many learners find these challenging (and that's completely normal!):

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Constraints
**Challenge:** "I'm not sure what to prevent"

**Strategy:** Start with learning protection constraints, then branch out to format and scope constraints as you gain confidence.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Few-Shot
**Challenge:** "My examples don't seem to work"

**Strategy:** Make format EXACTLY the same across all examples. Inconsistency confuses the AI.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Multi-Step
**Challenge:** "Should I use one prompt or chain them?"

**Strategy:** Try both approaches and compare results. The answer varies by task, so experimentation wins.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Combining Techniques
**Challenge:** "This is getting too complicated"

**Strategy:** Start with basics, then add one advanced technique at a time. Complexity has diminishing returns.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">

### Meta-Prompting
**Challenge:** "I don't know how to ask AI about prompts"

**Strategy:** Try these starter phrases:
- "Help me write a better prompt for..."
- "Evaluate this prompt and suggest improvements"
- "What would make this more effective?"

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Remember:** These are all learnable. Keep practicing.
