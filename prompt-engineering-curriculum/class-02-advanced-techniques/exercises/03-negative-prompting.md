# Negative Prompting & Constraint Exercises

Learn to improve AI responses by clearly stating what you DON'T want.

---

## Understanding Negative Prompting

Negative prompting means explicitly telling the AI what to AVOID or what NOT to do. This is often more effective than just stating what you want.

**Examples of Negative Prompts:**
- "Don't use complex vocabulary"
- "Don't make assumptions about missing information"
- "Don't plagiarize from the source material"
- "Don't include irrelevant examples"

**Effective Structure:**
```
What I want: [Positive instruction]
What I don't want: [Explicit list of what to avoid]
Why: [Brief explanation if helpful]
```

## Exercise 1: Academic Integrity Constraints

**Scenario:** You're asking for help with homework while maintaining academic integrity.

### 7th Grade Level: Understanding Not to Copy

**Task:** Write prompts that get help WITHOUT copying answers directly.

**Poor Prompt (Will Lead to Copying):**
```
Can you answer my math homework for me?
Question: A store has 24 apples and sells 7. How many are left?
```
Problem: This asks directly for answers, not understanding.

**Better Prompt (Academic Integrity):**
```
I'm learning to solve subtraction word problems. I want to understand HOW to solve them,
not just get the answer.

For this problem: "A store has 24 apples and sells 7. How many are left?"

Please:
- Don't give me the answer directly
- Explain the steps I should follow
- Ask me guiding questions: "What operation should I use? Why?"
- Help me check if my answer (once I solve it) makes sense

I'll solve it myself, then show you my work so you can check it.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear boundary: no copying answers
- Emphasis on understanding
- Student does the actual work
- AI acts as tutor, not answer machine

---

**Practice Writing Your Own:**

**Scenario 1:** You have an essay assignment on a book you read.

Your Goal: Understand the character's motivation without having the AI write your essay.

**Write a Negative Prompt:**
```
I'm writing an essay about [CHARACTER] from [BOOK].

I need your help, but I want to write my own essay:

Don't:
- Write my essay for me
- Give me a thesis statement I can copy
- Provide complete paragraphs

Do:
- Ask me questions about the character (What does he want? Why?)
- Help me identify scenes that show his motivation
- Explain what "character motivation" means if I'm unclear
- Review MY ideas and help me strengthen them

I'll do the actual writing. You're my thinking partner, not my writer.
```

**Scenario 2:** You need to understand a science concept better.

Your Goal: Learn the concept, not get notes to memorize word-for-word.

**Write a Negative Prompt:**
```
I'm studying [CONCEPT] but I'm confused.

Please help me understand, but:

Don't:
- Give me a definition I can just memorize
- Provide a study guide that's basically the textbook
- Use only technical jargon

Do:
- Explain using everyday examples
- Build from simple to complex
- Ask questions to check my understanding
- Point me back to textbook pages to read myself

I want to actually understand this, not just memorize something I don't get.
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Your prompt explicitly states what you won't do
- Help is focused on understanding, not providing answers
- You're clearly taking responsibility for your own work
- Clear boundaries between helpful guidance and academic dishonesty

---

### 9th Grade Level: Complex Constraint Management

**Task:** Balance multiple constraints: academic integrity, depth, originality, appropriate help.

**Scenario:** Requesting help with research paper without plagiarism.

**Better Prompt (Multiple Constraints):**
```
I'm writing a research paper on [TOPIC]. I need help, but with clear constraints:

What I WILL do myself:
- Find and read primary sources
- Take my own notes
- Write my own analysis and interpretation
- Create my own thesis and arguments

What I need your help with (without plagiarizing):
- Explaining concepts I don't understand
- Suggesting organizational structures
- Reviewing MY ideas and suggesting improvements
- Recommending scholarly sources to investigate

What I explicitly DON'T want:
- Quotations or phrases I could copy into my paper
- Pre-written analysis or interpretation
- Arguments presented as if they're mine but aren't
- Paraphrasing of sources (I'll do this myself)
- Summaries of entire sources (I'll read them)

How to help me: Instead of giving answers, ask me questions like:
- "What do you think [scholar's name] meant by...?"
- "How does this connect to your thesis?"
- "Can you find evidence in the text that supports that idea?"

This way you help me think deeply while I maintain my academic integrity.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Very specific boundaries
- Clear division of labor (what student does vs. what AI does)
- Focuses on thinking, not content generation
- Student remains the author

---

**Practice Writing Your Own:**

**Scenario 1:** Getting help with a programming assignment

Your Goal: Learn to code, not copy code that you can't explain.

**Write a Negative Prompt with Constraints:**
```
I'm learning to code in [LANGUAGE]. I'm stuck on [TASK].

Please help me UNDERSTAND, not write code for me:

Don't:
- Give me complete working code I can submit
- Write functions I'll just paste in
- Provide code longer than a few lines without explanation
- Use overly complex techniques to impress me

Do:
- Explain the concept I'm missing (loops, functions, data structures, etc.)
- Show tiny code examples (2-3 lines max)
- Ask me what I tried and why it didn't work
- Help me debug by guiding me to find the error
- Explain WHY a solution works, not just that it does

I want to write the code myself so I actually learn.
```

**Scenario 2:** Getting feedback on your own writing

Your Goal: Improve your writing, not have someone else write it for you.

**Write a Negative Prompt with Constraints:**
```
I wrote an essay about [TOPIC]. Can you give me feedback?

But please don't:
- Rewrite sentences for me
- Change my voice or style
- Fix all the grammar (I want to learn)
- Tell me what to think

Please do:
- Point out places where I'm unclear
- Ask questions about what I meant
- Suggest that [section] could be more specific
- Explain grammar concepts when I make mistakes
- Challenge my ideas (do I have evidence? is it logical?)
- Praise specific things I did well

I want to revise this myself, getting stronger as a writer.
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Constraints are explicit and specific
- Positive and negative constraints are both clear
- Constraints show respect for the learning process
- Help is focused on growth, not shortcuts
- Clear explanation of WHY these constraints matter

### 11th Grade Level: Navigating Complex Ethical Terrain

**Task:** Request help with nuanced situations where academic integrity isn't binary.

**Scenario:** Using AI as a research partner while maintaining originality.

**Advanced Prompt (Ethical Boundaries):**
```
I'm writing a college-level research paper on [COMPLEX TOPIC]. I want to use AI
as a thinking partner while maintaining scholarly integrity.

The boundaries I'm setting:

Content I will NOT ask you to generate:
- My thesis statement (I'll develop this)
- Complete arguments (I'll create these)
- Interpretations of sources (I'll analyze)
- Quotations or paraphrases of sources (I'll do this)
- Introduction/conclusion language (I'll write these)

Content I WILL ask you to help with:
- Conceptual understanding: "Explain the debate between [Scholar A] and [Scholar B]"
- Source evaluation: "Is this source credible? Why or why not?"
- Organization: "How should I structure this argument?"
- Brainstorming: "What angles haven't I considered?"
- Meta-analysis: "What assumptions am I making? Are they warranted?"
- Feedback on MY work: "Here's my paragraph. Is my logic sound?"

The distinction I'm maintaining:
- You can explain concepts from sources
- I will read and interpret sources myself
- You can help me understand scholarly conversations
- I will form my own interpretation and contribution

When in doubt, I will:
- Credit sources appropriately
- Reveal what you helped me understand
- Do my own analysis and interpretation
- Maintain my paper as primarily my work

This approach treats you as a research librarian or thinking partner, not as a
ghost-writer or content generator.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges gray areas in academic integrity
- Shows sophisticated understanding of proper AI use
- Maintains student as primary thinker/author
- Treats AI as tool for thinking, not for work completion
- Shows ethical reasoning, not just rule-following

---

**Practice Writing Your Own:**

**Scenario 1:** Using AI for test preparation

Your Goal: Learn the material, not get test answers.

**Write a Negative Prompt:**
```
I have a history exam coming up on [TIME PERIOD]. I want to prepare effectively.

Ways I will NOT use you:
- Don't give me practice test answers I can memorize
- Don't provide "everything you need to know" summaries
- Don't quiz me and then just give answers
- Don't provide exact sentences I could write in the exam

Ways I WILL use you:
- Help me understand WHY events happened, not just memorize dates
- Explain the significance of [specific topics I'm confused about]
- Ask me questions to test my understanding
- Point out gaps in my knowledge
- Help me make connections between different topics
- Suggest concepts I should review in my textbook
- Explain how to answer essay questions (the process), not provide answers

My exam tests understanding, not memorization, so I'll study to understand.
```

**Scenario 2:** Requesting feedback without someone else doing your work

Your Goal: Get genuine critique to improve, not have someone edit for you.

**Write a Negative Prompt:**
```
I wrote [ASSIGNMENT]. I need honest feedback, but I'm setting boundaries:

Don't:
- Rewrite anything for me
- Fix all my errors (show me, don't fix)
- Tell me what my conclusion should be
- Change my ideas

Please do:
- Point out where my logic breaks down
- Ask "How do you know that?" when I make unsupported claims
- Tell me specifically what works well (not just "good job")
- Suggest that I add evidence or explanation [here]
- Identify where I sound uncertain or confused
- Challenge ideas you disagree with
- Help me see what I'm assuming vs. what I've proven

I want to revise based on your feedback, not just accept changes.
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Shows nuanced understanding of academic integrity
- Boundaries are thoughtful, not just restrictive
- Acknowledges that AI can be helpful tool IF used properly
- Maintains student as primary thinker and author
- Demonstrates ethical reasoning about technology use

## Exercise 2: Format and Scope Constraints

**Scenario:** You want specific output format and length, not overly long or wrong format.

### 7th Grade Level: Length and Simplicity Constraints

**Task:** Make sure responses are appropriate for your reading level.

**Poor Prompt:**
```
What is photosynthesis?
```
Problem: No constraints on length, complexity, or format. AI might give college-level explanation.

**Better Prompt:**
```
What is photosynthesis?

Please:
- Keep your explanation to 3-4 sentences maximum
- Use words a 7th grader would understand (not "chlorophyll" without explaining it)
- Include one real-life example I can picture
- Don't assume I know biology vocabulary

Format: Simple paragraph (not a textbook-style explanation)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear length limit
- Appropriate complexity specified
- Format specified
- No jargon without explanation

---

**Practice Writing Your Own:**

**Scenario 1:** Get a summary, not a textbook chapter

```
Summarize the causes of the American Civil War for a 7th grade presentation.

Constraints:
- Maximum 200 words
- Explain as if talking to other 7th graders
- No sentences longer than 15 words (keep it simple)
- Include exactly 3 main causes
- Each cause should have 1 sentence of explanation
- Use a bulleted list format

Format Example:
Cause 1: [Title]
- [1-2 sentence explanation]

Cause 2: [Title]
- [1-2 sentence explanation]

And so on...
```

---

### 9th Grade Level: Specific Format Requirements

**Task:** Get exactly the format you need for your work.

**Scenario:** Creating flashcard content

**Better Prompt (Multiple Constraints):**
```
I'm making flashcards for my biology test on [TOPIC].

For each concept, I need:
- FRONT: The concept name only (2-3 words maximum)
- BACK: Definition (1-2 sentences) + one example
- NO jargon that wasn't in class
- Language should be exact enough for a test, but clear

Format (stick to this exactly):
---
FRONT: [Concept Name]
BACK: [Definition]. Example: [specific example]
---

Here are 3 examples of what I want:

Example 1:
---
FRONT: Mitochondria
BACK: The part of the cell that breaks down glucose to create energy (ATP). Example: Mitochondria help your muscle cells work when you exercise.
---

Example 2:
---
FRONT: Photosynthesis
BACK: The process plants use to convert sunlight into chemical energy stored in glucose. Example: Leaves turn sunlight and water into sugar and oxygen.
---

Example 3:
---
FRONT: Osmosis
BACK: The movement of water molecules across a membrane toward areas with more dissolved particles. Example: A raisin swells when soaked in water because water moves into it.
---

Now create flashcards on these concepts: [LIST OF CONCEPTS]

Remember: Front = short, Back = clear definition + concrete example, Format = exactly as shown
```

---

### 11th Grade Level: Complex Constraint Integration

**Task:** Combine multiple constraints for sophisticated output.

**Scenario:** Requesting a comparative analysis in specific format

**Advanced Prompt (Integrated Constraints):**
```
I'm analyzing how two historical figures approached [ISSUE]. I need output that is:

CONTENT CONSTRAINTS:
- Focused: Only discuss [specific aspect], not entire lives
- Evidence-based: Every claim supported by historical fact, not speculation
- Balanced: Give each figure equal treatment and space
- Interpretive: Go beyond "Person A did X, Person B did Y" to explain significance

STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Length: 800-1000 words exactly (not more, not less)
- Organization: Use this structure:
  * Introduction (100 words): Introduce both figures and the issue
  * Figure A Analysis (300 words): Their approach, why they took it, consequences
  * Figure B Analysis (300 words): Their approach, why they took it, consequences
  * Comparative Synthesis (200 words): How approaches differed, why, which was more effective
  * Conclusion (100 words): Significance of this comparison for understanding the period

LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS:
- Vocabulary: Advanced but accessible (college-level but not unnecessarily complex)
- Tone: Analytical but engaging (not textbook dry, but not casual)
- Evidence: Cite specific events/documents/quotes, not generalizations
- Avoid: Speculation, "probably/maybe," moral judgment, assumptions about intent

STYLISTIC CONSTRAINTS:
- Avoid: Long paragraphs (max 5 sentences), lists, tables, bullet points
- Use: Varied sentence structure, topic sentences that guide reader
- Integrate: Evidence smoothly into your analysis (don't let quotes dominate)
- Show, don't tell: Make argument clear through evidence and analysis, not by stating it

FORMAT:
- Titles for each section as listed above
- Double-spaced for review
- Numbered paragraphs for easy reference
```

Why This Works:
- Constraints cover content, structure, language, and style
- Very specific word count and section requirements
- Clear about what evidence should look like
- Specifies what NOT to do (speculation, lists, etc.)
- Provides explicit structural template

---

**Practice Writing Your Own:**

**Scenario 1:** Requesting lab report format

```
I need a lab report for my chemistry experiment on [TOPIC].

Format Requirements:
Title: [Your Title]
Date: [Date]
Partners: [Names]

Sections (in this order):
1. Objective (50 words): What were you testing? Why?
2. Materials (bullet list): Everything used in experiment
3. Procedure (step-by-step): Numbered steps exactly as you did them
4. Results (data presentation): Include your data table/graph
5. Analysis (150-200 words): What do your results mean? What happened and why?
6. Conclusion (100 words): Did you answer your question? What did you learn?
7. Errors (100 words): What could affect accuracy? What would you do differently?

Style:
- Use past tense (we heated, we measured)
- Be specific (not "we mixed things" but "we combined 5g NaOH with 10mL HCl")
- Include units (grams, milliliters, Celsius)
- Separate data from interpretation (facts in Results, meaning in Analysis)
```

**Scenario 2:** Requesting college essay feedback

```
I'm applying to [COLLEGE]. Here's my essay on [PROMPT]. I need feedback with these constraints:

Focus Areas (in this order):
1. Question Response: Does my essay answer what was asked? (Explain where if not)
2. Authenticity: Does this sound like me? Are there moments where I sound like a thesaurus?
3. Structure: Does the essay build logically? Are there jarring transitions?
4. Support: Do I show, not just tell? Is there concrete evidence (examples, stories)?
5. Risk: Did I take a genuine risk or play it safe?
6. Ending: Does the conclusion feel earned and memorable?

Format for Feedback:
- Give specific praise first (point to 1-2 sentences that work really well and why)
- Note areas for improvement (not as criticism, but as growth opportunities)
- Ask questions where things are unclear (don't tell me to fix, help me see the gap)
- Suggest specifically, not vaguely ("Add an example about..." not "Add more examples")
- Be honest about impact (how would this land with an admissions officer?)

Please don't:
- Rewrite anything
- Fix grammar/spelling (focus on bigger issues)
- Tell me what to think
- Give me an "overall grade"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Multiple constraints are specified (content, format, language, style)
- Constraints are specific enough to guide but not restrict creativity
- Negative constraints ("don't") are included
- Format/structure is clearly laid out
- Expectations are measurable (word count, section titles, etc.)
- Tone and style are specified
- Shows sophisticated understanding of assignment requirements

## Exercise 3: Combining Constraints with Other Techniques

**Scenario:** Use constraints along with multi-step and few-shot techniques for powerful prompts.

### Example: Multi-Step + Few-Shot + Constraints

**Context:** Writing a persuasive essay on a controversial topic

**Combined Prompt:**
```
I'm writing a persuasive essay on [TOPIC]. I want a strong argument, not propaganda.

CONSTRAINTS (what I don't want):
- Don't attack the other side's character (stick to ideas)
- Don't use emotional manipulation
- Don't present opinion as fact
- Don't ignore legitimate counterarguments
- Don't make claims without evidence

EXAMPLES (show me the style I want):

Good persuasive paragraph:
"Many argue that [alternative view]. This view has merit because [acknowledge strength].
However, [your position] is more compelling because [specific evidence]. For example,
[concrete case]. This demonstrates that [how example supports position], which suggests
[broader implication]."

Bad persuasive paragraph:
"Everyone knows that [position] is right. People who disagree are either stupid or
evil. Obviously [your view is correct]. Wake up, people! The evidence clearly shows
[vague claim without proof]."

Paragraph I wrote:
[Your paragraph here]

MULTI-STEP FEEDBACK (help me improve step by step):
Step 1: Is my main argument clear? What am I claiming?
Step 2: Do I acknowledge the other side's view fairly?
Step 3: Is my evidence specific (not vague generalizations)?
Step 4: Does my evidence actually support my claim?
Step 5: How would someone who disagrees react? Would they feel heard?
Step 6: What would make this argument more convincing?
```

---

### Example: Constraints + Specific Format

**Context:** Preparing study materials with precise format requirements

```
I'm preparing study materials. For each concept, I need:

FORMAT CONSTRAINT (exactly this structure):
Q: [Question about the concept]
A: [Answer in 2-3 sentences maximum]
Why It Matters: [1 sentence explaining why you should know this]
Real Example: [A concrete example, not just abstract definition]
Common Mistake: [What students often get wrong]
---

CONTENT CONSTRAINTS:
- Questions should be at the level I'll be tested on
- Answers must be accurate and complete but concise
- Examples should be ones I can picture (not abstract)
- Common mistakes should be things I actually do

EXAMPLE (what I want):

Q: What is the difference between mitochondria and chloroplasts?
A: Mitochondria are organelles that break down glucose to create energy (ATP). Chloroplasts are organelles that use sunlight to create glucose. Mitochondria are in all cells; chloroplasts are only in plant cells.
Why It Matters: These are the power plants of cells—understanding them explains how cells get energy.
Real Example: Your muscle cells have many mitochondria (they need lots of energy to contract). A leaf cell has chloroplasts (it needs to capture sunlight).
Common Mistake: Thinking both make energy from sunlight. Only chloroplasts use sunlight.

---

Now create study cards on these concepts: [LIST]

Remember: Exactly follow the format, keep answers short, use real examples.
```
