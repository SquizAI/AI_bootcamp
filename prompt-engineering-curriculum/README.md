## üí° Core Concepts Covered

### Role-Based Prompting
Get expert-level help by assigning AI a specific role:
> "Act as a biology teacher explaining photosynthesis to a 9th grader..."

### Multi-Step Prompting
Break complex problems into manageable steps:
> "First, help me identify the key concepts. Then, explain each one. Finally, show how they connect."

### Few-Shot Prompting
Teach AI your preferences with examples:
> "Here's an example of the explanation style I need... Now explain this new concept similarly."

### Context Engineering
Provide the right background information:
> "I'm a 10th grader learning quadratic equations. I understand basic algebra but struggle with factoring..."

### Negative Prompting
Tell AI what NOT to do:
> "Explain this without giving me the answer directly. Don't solve it for me."

### Meta-Prompting
Create prompts that generate better prompts:
> "Help me design a prompt template for getting help with history essay analysis."
