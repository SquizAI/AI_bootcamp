## 0:20-0:35 | System Instructions Deep Dive (15 min)

### Concept: System instructions are like "programming" AI's role for entire conversations

System instructions are special prompts that apply to EVERY message in the conversation, not just one.

### What Are System Instructions?

System instructions:
- Apply to EVERY message in the conversation
- Define the AI's persistent role, expertise, and approach
- Set constraints and guidelines upfront
- Save you from repeating yourself
- Can be saved and reused

**Analogy:** Think of regular prompts as giving someone specific directions for one trip. System instructions are like installing a GPS with your preferences already set—it knows your preferred routes, avoids highways, and always gives you time estimates. It applies those preferences to every trip.

### See the Difference

**Without System Instructions:**
```
Regular chat:
You: "Help me with algebra"
AI: [generic response]
You: "I'm a 9th grader and I want Socratic questions, not answers"
AI: [adjusts]
You: "Now help with the next problem"
AI: [might forget the approach]
You: [has to remind AI again]
```

**With System Instructions:**
```
System Instruction: "You are a patient algebra tutor for 9th grade students. Use the Socratic method—guide students with questions rather than giving answers. Keep explanations at grade level. Encourage showing work."

You: "Help me with this equation: 2x + 5 = 13"
AI: [Socratic response with questions]
You: "Now this one: 3x - 7 = 20"
AI: [continues same approach automatically]
```

**Try it:** Test this difference in AI Studio

### Anatomy of Good System Instructions

**The System Instruction Formula:**

**1. Role & Expertise**
- Who should the AI be?
- What expertise do they have?

**2. Audience & Context**
- Who are you (grade level, background)?
- What's the general purpose?

**3. Approach & Methodology**
- How should the AI teach/help?
- What teaching philosophy?

**4. Persistent Constraints**
- What should AI NEVER do?
- What guidelines must always apply?

**5. Format Preferences** (optional)
- Preferred response structure
- Length, style, tone

### Example Breakdown

```
You are an expert biology tutor specializing in high school students. [ROLE]

You work with 10th graders who are learning foundational biology concepts. [AUDIENCE]

Your teaching approach is to:
- Start with what students already know
- Use real-world analogies and examples
- Build understanding step-by-step
- Encourage students to make connections [METHODOLOGY]

Important constraints:
- Never provide complete answers to homework problems
- Always ask students to explain their thinking
- Keep explanations at 10th grade reading level
- Use gender-neutral language [CONSTRAINTS]

Format your responses with:
- Clear section headers
- Concrete examples
- Questions to check understanding [FORMAT]
```

**Try it:** Test this system instruction with a few biology questions

### Building Subject-Specific Systems

**Practice: Math Homework Helper**

Build your own math system instruction:

```
You are a patient and encouraging math tutor for [grade level] students.

You help students with [specific math course] homework by:
1. First asking students what they understand and where they're stuck
2. Breaking problems into smaller, manageable steps
3. Guiding with questions rather than solving problems directly
4. Encouraging students to show their work
5. Celebrating progress and effort

Important rules:
- NEVER solve problems for students—guide them to solve on their own
- Always ask "What do you think the next step is?" before explaining
- If a student is completely stuck, show ONE similar example, then have them try
- Use encouraging language and positive reinforcement
- Keep mathematical notation clear and properly formatted

When a student gets stuck:
- Ask what they've tried already
- Help them identify which concept or formula might apply
- Break the problem into smaller parts
- Guide them through reasoning, not just calculation
```

**Try it:** Test this with a current math problem

### Saving and Organizing

**How to save a system instruction:**

1. Write system instruction
2. Test it with a few messages
3. If it works well, name the chat
4. Save it to "Prompt library" with descriptive name
   - Example names: "Algebra Tutor - Grade 9", "Essay Brainstorming Coach", "Biology Study Partner"

**How to reuse a system instruction:**

1. Open saved prompt from library
2. Click "Use in new chat"
3. System instruction carries over
4. Start new conversation with same setup

**Tip:** You can edit system instructions during conversation and create variations for different needs. Build a collection over time.

## 0:35-0:50 | Meta-Prompting Strategies (15 min)

### Concept: Instead of just using AI, use AI to help you communicate with AI better

Meta-prompting = Using AI to help you create, improve, or analyze prompts.

### What is Meta-Prompting?

**Why it's powerful:**
- AI understands what makes effective prompts
- Can help you design prompts for specific situations
- Identifies weaknesses in your prompts
- Generates templates for common tasks

**The Meta-Prompt Concept:**

Instead of asking: "Help me with my essay"
You ask: "Help me create a prompt that will help me brainstorm for my essay"

**The Ladder:**
- Level 1: Use AI to solve problems
- Level 2: Use AI to help you learn
- Level 3: Use AI to help you use AI better (META!)

**You're at Level 3 now.**

### Types of Meta-Prompts

**Type 1: Prompt Generation**

Use when you need to create a prompt for a new situation.

**Example:**
```
I need to create a system instruction for Gemini AI Studio that will help me with chemistry homework. I'm a 10th grader studying chemical reactions, stoichiometry, and balancing equations.

Please generate a comprehensive system instruction that:
- Establishes the AI as a chemistry tutor
- Uses guided questioning instead of giving answers
- Includes safety about not doing homework for me
- Keeps explanations at my grade level

Format it as a complete system instruction I can copy directly into AI Studio.
```

**Try it:** Watch the AI generate a system instruction

---

**Type 2: Prompt Improvement**

Use when you have a prompt that kind of works but could be better.

**Example:**
```
I've been using this prompt for history homework:

"Act as a history teacher and help me understand the causes of the Civil War."

It's okay, but the responses are sometimes too broad or too simple. Can you analyze this prompt and suggest improvements? Then provide an improved version that:
- Gets more specific, targeted help
- Ensures appropriate depth for 11th grade
- Guides the AI to use primary sources when relevant
- Prevents overly simplistic explanations
```

**Try it:** Watch the AI analyze and improve a prompt

---

**Type 3: Template Creation**

Use when you need reusable prompts for similar situations.

**Example:**
```
I frequently need help analyzing poems in my English class. Create a reusable template prompt that I can use for any poem analysis by filling in specific details.

The template should:
- Guide me through literary analysis (not just summarize)
- Ask about specific elements: imagery, metaphor, tone, theme, structure
- Help me develop my own interpretations
- Be appropriate for 9th grade literature

Format it with [BRACKETS] around the parts I'll customize for each poem.
```

**Try it:** Watch AI creating a fill-in-the-blank template

---

**Type 4: Prompt Diagnosis**

Use when a prompt isn't working and you don't know why.

**Example:**
```
I tried this prompt but got unhelpful results:

"Explain photosynthesis"

The AI gave me a super long, detailed explanation with college-level terminology. I just needed a clear, simple explanation for my 7th grade science homework.

What went wrong with my prompt? What should I change to get better results?
```

**Try it:** Watch AI diagnosing the problem

### The Meta-Prompt Template

**For Creating System Instructions:**

```
I need to create a system instruction for Gemini AI Studio for [SUBJECT/PURPOSE].

Context about me:
- I'm a [GRADE] grade student
- I'm currently studying [TOPICS]
- My learning style is [VISUAL/STEP-BY-STEP/EXAMPLES-BASED/etc.]
- I need help with [SPECIFIC CHALLENGE]

Please create a comprehensive system instruction that establishes:
1. The AI's role and expertise
2. My grade level and context
3. The teaching approach that works best for me
4. Clear constraints about academic integrity (guide me, don't do work for me)
5. Preferred response format and style

Format the output as a complete system instruction I can paste directly into AI Studio's system instruction field.

After creating it, explain why you made specific choices and suggest when I might want to modify it.
```

**Try it:** Test this meta-prompt with your subject

### The Meta-Prompting Workflow

**Step 1: Identify the need**
- What type of help do I need repeatedly?
- What prompt would I use over and over?

**Step 2: Use meta-prompting**
- Ask AI to help create the perfect prompt
- Provide context about your needs
- Request specific features

**Step 3: Test and refine**
- Try the generated prompt/system instruction
- See if it produces helpful results
- Ask AI to improve based on what didn't work

**Step 4: Save and reuse**
- Save successful prompts to AI Studio library
- Document what each one is for
- Build your collection over time

**This is how you become a prompt engineering expert.**
