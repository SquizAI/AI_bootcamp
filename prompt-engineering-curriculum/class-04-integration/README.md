## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: Integration vs. Individual Techniques

> Moving from using one technique at a time to combining multiple strategies seamlessly

<div align="center">

| Technique Combination | Application | Benefit |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Role-based + Multi-step** | Complex problem-solving | Clear thinking pathway |
| **Few-shot + Constraints** | Consistent output | Quality control |
| **Context engineering + System instructions** | Personalized help | Tailored responses |
| **All techniques together** | Real-world scenarios | Professional results |

</div>

### Concept 2: Personal Prompt Libraries

> Organized collections of proven prompts that can be reused and adapted

- **Subject-specific prompt templates** - English, Math, Science, History
- **Task-type categories** - Explaining, Practicing, Checking, Planning
- **Saved AI Studio configurations** - Pre-built learning partners
- **Documentation of effectiveness** - What works for your style

### Concept 3: Sustainable Learning Workflows

> Repeatable processes for common academic tasks

```
Research & Note-Taking → Essay Writing & Revision →
Problem Set Assistance → Study & Exam Prep →
Project Planning & Execution
```

Key workflow areas:
- Research and note-taking workflows
- Essay writing and revision processes
- Problem set assistance systems
- Study and exam preparation routines
- Project planning and execution frameworks

### Concept 4: Ethical AI Use Framework

> Clear guidelines applicable to any AI use decision

<div align="center">

**The "Learning vs. Shortcutting" Test**

Does this AI use help me **understand** or just help me **bypass learning**?

</div>

Framework components:
- When to cite AI assistance
- Boundaries for different assignment types
- School policy compliance
- Building genuine understanding alongside AI use

### Concept 5: AI as Learning Partner (Not Replacement)

> The mindset shift that ensures long-term success

- AI enhances but doesn't replace thinking
- Struggle and effort are essential for learning
- AI helps with understanding, not just completion
- The learner remains the driver of their education

## Common Challenges & Solutions

<div align="center">

### Challenge: "I don't have enough prompts for a library"

> **Solution:** Review Classes 1-3 materials, adapt provided templates, create variations to reach 15+ prompts

### Challenge: "My assignment isn't complex enough"

> **Solution:** Apply techniques to planning, outlining, or deeper understanding beyond the assignment itself

### Challenge: "I'm confused about what's ethical"

> **Solution:** Use the "Learning vs. Shortcutting" test — Does this help me understand or bypass learning?

### Challenge: "I won't remember all this after the course"

> **Solution:** That's why you're building a library — these become your resources going forward
