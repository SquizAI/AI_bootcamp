# End-of-Quarter Showcase Project - Revision Summary

## What Changed: AI Skills Integration

### Overview
The revised rubric now **explicitly requires students to demonstrate the AI skills** they've been learning throughout the course. AI literacy is no longer just mentioned in passing — it's a core, graded component worth 20% of the total project score.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### BEFORE: Purpose Statement
> "This project is your opportunity to showcase what you've learned and how AI supported that process..."

### AFTER: Purpose Statement
> "This project is your opportunity to showcase:
> 1. **What you learned** (content knowledge)
> 2. **How AI helped you learn it** (tools and strategies)
> 3. **What you learned FROM using AI** (insights about AI as a learning tool)"

## What Students Must Now Demonstrate

### Content Knowledge (Still Important - 25 points)
- Understanding of unit topics
- Evidence and examples
- Personal connections

### AI Literacy Skills (Now Equally Important - 20 points)
Students must show they can:

1. **Use AI tools strategically**
   - Select appropriate tools for different tasks
   - Document what tools they used and why

2. **Engineer effective prompts**
   - Show progression from weak to strong prompts
   - Demonstrate iterative refinement
   - Explain what makes a good prompt

3. **Think critically about AI outputs**
   - Fact-check and verify information
   - Identify errors or biases
   - Cross-reference sources

4. **Reflect metacognitively**
   - Understand AI strengths and limitations
   - Articulate what they learned FROM using AI
   - Develop strategies for effective AI use

5. **Use AI ethically**
   - Cite AI assistance appropriately
   - Put information in own words
   - Use AI to enhance (not replace) learning

---

## Why These Changes Matter

### For Students:
- Clear expectations for demonstrating AI skills
- Guidance on HOW to showcase AI learning
- Models and examples to follow
- Recognition that AI literacy is a valuable skill

### For Teachers:
- Concrete criteria for grading AI skill demonstration
- Evidence that students are learning WITH and FROM AI (not just using it)
- Ability to assess critical thinking about AI tools
- Framework for evaluating AI literacy development

### For Assessment:
- 20% of grade now explicitly tied to AI skills
- Objective criteria for evaluation
- Multiple evidence points (documentation, examples, reflection)
- Alignment with 21st-century skill standards

---

## Implementation Notes

### What Teachers Should Emphasize:
1. Save AI conversations throughout the unit (for documentation)
2. Take screenshots of interesting interactions
3. Keep a learning log or journal about AI usage
4. Practice prompt refinement (don't just accept first result)
5. Always verify important facts from AI responses

### What Makes Strong AI Documentation:
- **Specificity:** Actual prompts and responses, not generic descriptions
- **Growth:** Shows improvement in AI usage over time
- **Critical Thinking:** Questions AI outputs, verifies information
- **Metacognition:** Reflects on own learning process
- **Honesty:** Acknowledges challenges and mistakes

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- ❌ Just listing AI tools without showing HOW they were used
- ❌ Generic reflections ("AI helped me learn")
- ❌ No evidence of prompt refinement or iteration
- ❌ No fact-checking or verification examples
- ❌ Treating AI as infallible or just accepting all outputs

## Sample Student Documentation (What "Excellent" Looks Like)

A student earning 18-20 points in AI Literacy would show:

**Documentation:**
- "I used ChatGPT for initial brainstorming, Claude for deep research questions, and Perplexity for fact-checking. Here's why I chose each tool..."

**Prompt Iteration:**
- 3+ examples showing weak prompt → refined prompt → better result
- Explanation of what changed and why
- Discussion of what makes a good prompt

**Critical Thinking:**
- "AI told me X, but when I checked Y source, I found Z. This taught me..."
- Multiple examples of verification
- Discussion of AI errors or limitations encountered

**Reflection:**
- Thoughtful analysis of AI strengths and weaknesses
- Discussion of how AI changed their learning process
- Specific strategies for future AI use
- Understanding of when to use (and not use) AI

**Integration:**
- AI documentation woven throughout presentation
- Not an afterthought or separate section
- Shows AI as integral part of learning process

---

## Next Steps for Teachers

1. **Share revised rubric** with students at project start
2. **Model AI documentation** throughout the unit (think-aloud process)
3. **Collect AI conversations** as homework or classwork
4. **Practice prompt refinement** as a class activity
5. **Fact-check together** to demonstrate verification process
6. **Review examples** from this document with students
7. **Provide feedback** on AI documentation during drafts
8. **Celebrate strong examples** of AI literacy in presentations

---

## Questions for Consideration

As you implement this revised rubric, consider:

1. Will students submit AI documentation separately or integrate it into presentations?
2. How will you handle students who didn't save their AI conversations?
3. Should you require a minimum number of AI interactions documented?
4. Will you provide a template or structure for the AI process log?
5. How will you grade AI documentation for students with limited AI access?

---

## Conclusion

This revised rubric ensures that the End-of-Quarter Showcase Project truly reflects the **dual learning objectives** of your AI Skills Camp:

1. **Content mastery** (learning about topics with AI support)
2. **AI literacy** (learning to use AI effectively and critically)

Students will now be explicitly evaluated on both dimensions, making this a comprehensive assessment of their growth throughout the quarter.

The 20-point AI Literacy category sends a clear message: **Learning HOW to learn with AI is just as important as the content itself.**
