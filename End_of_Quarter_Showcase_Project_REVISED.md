---

### 2. Speech / Presentation Content Outline

Your presentation should follow this structure:

#### A. Introduction (1–2 minutes)
- Briefly describe what topics you'll cover
- **Mention the AI tools you used** (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, NotebookLM, etc.)

**Example:**
> "Over the past six weeks, we've explored how different cultures express identity and how individuals can grow through challenges. I used Claude AI to help me research perspectives, organize my thoughts, and create visual aids. Today, I'll share three key lessons that changed the way I see the world—and how AI helped me discover them."

#### B. Main Body (4–6 minutes)
Organize by **3–4 main topics or themes** from your unit. For each one, include:

**Topic Overview:**
- What was this topic about?
- What were the key ideas, facts, or concepts?

**Evidence of Learning:**
- Include content you created, images, charts, quotes, short passages, or data
- Visuals can be in a slideshow or poster

**AI-Assisted Learning Process:**
- **What AI tools did you use for this topic?**
- **What prompts or questions did you ask the AI?**
- **How did the AI's response help you understand better?**
- **What did you do with the AI's output?** (research further, verify facts, synthesize ideas, create something new)

**Personal Reaction or Reflection:**
- What did you find interesting, surprising, or challenging?
- How did your thinking change?
- **What did you learn about using AI effectively?** (e.g., asking better questions, verifying information, using AI as a starting point)

**Connection to Life / Present Day:**
- How does this topic apply to you, your community, or the world today?

**Example Format:**
```
Topic 1: The Power of Perspective

WHAT I LEARNED:
Every culture tells stories differently to express shared values.
Quote: "Until the lion learns to write, every story will glorify the hunter." — African Proverb

HOW AI HELPED:
I asked Claude: "How do different cultures use storytelling to preserve their history?"
The AI gave me examples from 5 continents and suggested I look into oral traditions vs. written histories.
I then researched specific examples (Griots in West Africa, Aboriginal Dreamtime stories).
I used the AI to help me create a comparison chart of storytelling methods.

WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT AI:
At first, my prompt was too vague ("Tell me about culture").
When I asked specific questions, I got much better answers.
I learned to fact-check AI responses—one story example was actually incorrect!

PERSONAL REFLECTION:
This made me realize how important it is to listen to different voices in the media.

CONNECTION TO TODAY:
With social media, everyone can share their story—but we must learn to listen critically.
```

#### C. Conclusion (1–2 minutes)
- Summarize your key content takeaways
- **Summarize your key AI learning takeaways**
- Explain how this learning (both content AND AI skills) has impacted you personally or academically
- End with a strong statement, quote, or question that leaves your audience thinking

**Example:**
> "Learning about identity and perspective taught me that empathy isn't just a skill—it's a choice we make every day. And learning WITH AI taught me that technology is a tool that's only as good as the questions we ask it."

#### D. Q&A Session (Built into presentation time)
After your presentation:
- The audience (teachers or peers) will ask 2–3 questions
- You should respond thoughtfully, using your own words and understanding — not memorized answers

**Tip:** Prepare by reviewing your notes and thinking about how each topic connects to the bigger picture.

### 3. AI Learning Documentation & Process Log
**This is a required component that demonstrates your AI literacy skills.**

Create a **1-2 page document or section** in your presentation that shows:

#### A. AI Tools Used
List all AI tools you used and what you used them for:
- **Example:** "ChatGPT for brainstorming, Claude for research, Perplexity for fact-checking, Canva AI for image generation"

#### B. Sample Prompts & Iterations
Include **at least 3 examples** showing:
1. **Your initial prompt** (what you first asked the AI)
2. **The AI's response** (brief summary or screenshot)
3. **How you refined your prompt** (what you changed and why)
4. **The improved result**

**Example:**
```
ITERATION 1:
Prompt: "Tell me about the civil rights movement"
Problem: Too broad, got a generic overview

ITERATION 2:
Prompt: "What were three specific strategies used during the Montgomery Bus Boycott and how did each one contribute to its success?"
Result: Much better! Got detailed information I could actually use and verify.

WHAT I LEARNED: Specific questions get specific answers. Including "how" and "why" helps me understand, not just memorize facts.
```

#### C. Verification & Critical Thinking
Show how you fact-checked or verified AI information:
- What sources did you use to verify AI responses?
- Did you find any errors or biases in AI outputs?
- How did you cross-reference information?

**Example:**
> "The AI told me that [X event] happened in 1965, but when I checked the National Archives, it actually happened in 1963. This taught me that AI can make mistakes with dates and facts, so I always verify important information."

#### D. Reflection on AI as a Learning Tool
Answer these questions in 1-2 paragraphs:
- How did using AI change the way you approach learning?
- What are the strengths and limitations of AI for learning?
- What strategies did you develop for using AI effectively?
- How will you use AI tools in the future?

---

### 4. Visual Component
You must include **at least 3 visual elements** that support your presentation:
- Images, charts, or infographics
- Quotes or key terms
- Diagrams or short bullet lists of data
- Screenshots of AI interactions (optional but encouraged)
- Comparison tables or timelines

**Requirements:**
- Visuals must be clear, relevant, and original
- No copy-pasting large chunks of text
- If you used AI to generate visuals, **cite this** (e.g., "Image created with DALL-E" or "Chart data organized with Claude AI")

## Helpful Tips

### Content Tips
- Practice your speech out loud — time yourself and work on speaking clearly and confidently
- Use note cards or slides to stay organized, not to read word-for-word
- Think about your tone, eye contact, and pacing
- Anticipate possible questions and plan how you might answer them

### AI Usage Tips
- **Save your AI conversations** as you go — you'll need them for documentation
- **Take notes** on what worked and what didn't when using AI
- **Screenshot interesting interactions** to include in your process log
- **Be honest** about challenges you faced with AI tools
- **Show your thinking** — the goal is to demonstrate HOW you used AI to learn, not just that you used it

### Academic Integrity Reminder
- AI is a **tool to help you learn**, not to do the work for you
- Always **put information in your own words** after researching with AI
- **Cite AI assistance** just like you would cite a book or website
- **Think critically** about AI outputs — don't just accept them as truth
- Your presentation should show YOUR understanding, not the AI's response

## Examples of Strong AI Documentation

### Example 1: Showing Growth in Prompt Engineering
```
WEEK 1 PROMPT: "Write about democracy"
→ Result was generic and not helpful for my specific topic

WEEK 3 PROMPT: "Compare the key principles of Athenian democracy with modern American democracy, focusing on citizen participation"
→ Got specific, comparable information I could use

WEEK 5 PROMPT: "I'm researching how citizen participation in democracy has changed over time. Can you provide 3 specific examples from different time periods and explain what factors influenced those changes? Please cite historical evidence."
→ Got detailed, verifiable information with context

WHAT THIS SHOWS: I learned to be specific, ask for evidence, and frame questions that help me understand WHY things happened, not just WHAT happened.
```

### Example 2: Demonstrating Critical Thinking
```
AI OUTPUT: "The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1920..."
MY VERIFICATION: Checked Britannica.com — actually signed June 28, 1919
MY LEARNING: AI can make factual errors, especially with dates. Always verify historical facts.

AI OUTPUT: "Some historians argue that..."
MY ACTION: Asked "Which specific historians argue this?" then researched those scholars
MY LEARNING: When AI says "some people think" or "it's believed that" — that's vague. I need to find the actual sources and perspectives.
```

### Example 3: Thoughtful Reflection
```
"At the beginning of this unit, I thought AI would just give me answers to copy. Instead, I learned that AI is more like having a really knowledgeable study partner who can help me explore ideas — but I still have to do the thinking.

The biggest surprise was learning that the QUALITY of my questions directly affects the QUALITY of the answers. When I asked lazy questions, I got lazy answers. When I asked thoughtful, specific questions, I got information that actually helped me understand deeper concepts.

I also learned that AI doesn't replace research — it's a starting point. I still needed to verify facts, read primary sources, and form my own conclusions. In the future, I'll use AI to help me brainstorm, organize ideas, and explore different perspectives — but I'll always fact-check and think critically about the information it provides."
```
