# Exercise 2: Context Engineering Practice

## Learning Objective
Master the skill of providing clear, helpful context that makes AI responses relevant to your specific learning situation.

## Why Context Matters

AI doesn't know:
- Your grade level or age
- What you've already learned
- What you're struggling with specifically
- Your learning style preferences
- Your assignment requirements

**You need to tell it! That's context engineering.**

---

## The Context Framework

Good context includes:

### 1. Your Level
- Grade level
- Course level (honors, AP, etc.)
- Experience with the topic

### 2. Your Current Understanding
- What you already know
- What you've learned so far
- Concepts you're comfortable with

### 3. Your Specific Confusion
- What you don't understand
- Where you're getting stuck
- The gap in your knowledge

### 4. Your Need
- Why you're learning this
- What you need to be able to do
- The assignment or assessment

### 5. Your Preferences (optional)
- How you learn best
- Preferred explanation style
- Any accommodations

**Layer 2: Add Your Grade Level**
```
[Rewrite adding grade level]


```

**Test this. Did the response improve?** (Rate 1-5): ____

**What changed?**

---

**Layer 3: Add What You Already Know**
```
[Rewrite adding prior knowledge]



```

**Test this. Better?** (Rate 1-5): ____

**What changed?**

---

**Layer 4: Add Your Specific Confusion**
```
[Rewrite adding specific struggle]

## Common Context Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Vague About Level
❌ "I'm a student learning..."
✅ "I'm a 9th grade student in honors biology..."

### Mistake 2: Assuming AI Knows What You Know
❌ "Explain the next part"
✅ "I understand X and Y, but not Z..."

### Mistake 3: Not Explaining the Confusion
❌ "I don't get this"
✅ "I understand the concept but can't apply it to word problems..."

### Mistake 4: Missing the Assignment Context
❌ "Help with my essay"
✅ "I'm writing a 5-paragraph essay for English class, thesis statement needs work..."

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Learning Preferences
❌ [No mention of how you learn]
✅ "I learn best with visual examples..." or "I need step-by-step breakdown..."

## Extension Activities

### Activity 1: Context Comparison Study
Take ONE question. Write THREE prompts with different amounts of context:
1. Minimal context
2. Medium context
3. Rich context

Test all three and compare the helpfulness of responses.

**Conclusion: How much context is optimal?**

---

### Activity 2: Build a Personal Context Template
Create a reusable template for your most common needs:

```
Standard Math Help Template:
- I'm a [grade] student in [course]
- We're currently learning [topic]
- I understand [what I know]
- I'm confused about [specific issue]
- I need [type of help]
- I learn best when [learning preference]
```

---

### Activity 3: Help a Peer Add Context
Partner with a classmate. Exchange prompts and help each other:
- Identify missing context
- Suggest what to add
- Test the improved versions
- Discuss what helped

---

## Self-Assessment

After these exercises, can you:

- [ ] Identify when a prompt lacks context
- [ ] Add relevant context about your learning level
- [ ] Explain what you know vs. don't know
- [ ] Specify your exact confusion or need
- [ ] Include assignment requirements when relevant
- [ ] Adjust context for different subjects
- [ ] Get more helpful responses by providing better context

**All checked? You're ready to use context engineering with real homework!**

---

## Reflection Questions

1. **What type of context** made the biggest difference in response quality?

2. **When is more context better** vs. when is it too much?

3. **How will providing context** change how you use AI for homework?

4. **What's one thing** you'll always include in context from now on?

---

## Connection to Real Work

Context engineering isn't just for AI—it's a life skill:

- Asking teachers for help (provide context about what you know)
- Asking peers for tutoring (explain where you're stuck)
- Searching online (specific context gets better results)
- Future job communication (context makes requests clear)

**You're learning to communicate your learning needs clearly. That's valuable everywhere!**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Save your best prompts** with good context—reuse them!
2. **Apply this to homework** this week
3. **Notice when context makes a difference** in your other conversations
4. **Experiment** with how much context works best for you

**You now have two powerful techniques: role-based prompting + context engineering. Combined, they're incredibly effective!**

## Need Help?

**Not sure what context to include?**
→ Use the Context Checklist above

**Responses still not helpful?**
→ Try adding more specific detail about your confusion

**Want to see examples?**
→ Check the exercise-solutions.md file

**Ready for more?**
→ Combine this with role-based prompting from Exercise 1!

**Remember: AI can't read your mind. Context is how you help it understand exactly what you need. The better your context, the better your learning support!**
