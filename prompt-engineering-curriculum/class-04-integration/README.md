# Class 4: Integration & Application

## üéØ Class Overview

This final 90-minute session brings together everything students have learned in Classes 1-3, focusing on real-world application and building sustainable AI learning systems. Students create personal prompt libraries, apply integrated techniques to complex assignments, and develop ethical frameworks for ongoing AI use.

**This is the capstone** where techniques become systems, and skills become habits. Students leave with actionable workflows they can use independently across all their courses.

**Prerequisites:** Completion of Classes 1-3 (role-based prompting, advanced techniques, and Gemini AI Studio)

## üìã Learning Objectives

By the end of this class, students will be able to:

1. **Integrate** multiple prompting techniques for complex tasks
2. **Design** personal prompt libraries organized by subject and task type
3. **Build** sustainable AI learning workflows for different academic needs
4. **Apply** all learned techniques to a complex real-world assignment
5. **Articulate** ethical guidelines for AI use in academic settings
6. **Evaluate** when and how to use AI appropriately
7. **Create** reusable systems that support ongoing learning
8. **Reflect** on their learning journey and continued growth

## üéì Key Concepts

### 1. Integration vs. Individual Techniques
Moving from using one technique at a time to combining multiple strategies seamlessly:
- Role-based + multi-step for complex problem-solving
- Few-shot + constraints for consistent output
- Context engineering + system instructions for personalized help
- All techniques working together in real scenarios

### 2. Personal Prompt Libraries
Organized collections of proven prompts that students can reuse and adapt:
- Subject-specific prompt templates
- Task-type categories (explaining, practicing, checking, planning)
- Saved AI Studio configurations
- Documentation of what works best for their learning style

### 3. Sustainable Learning Workflows
Repeatable processes for common academic tasks:
- Research and note-taking workflows
- Essay writing and revision processes
- Problem set assistance systems
- Study and exam preparation routines
- Project planning and execution frameworks

### 4. Ethical AI Use Framework
Clear guidelines students can apply to any AI use decision:
- The "Learning vs. Shortcutting" test
- When to cite AI assistance
- Boundaries for different assignment types
- School policy compliance
- Building genuine understanding alongside AI use

### 5. AI as Learning Partner (Not Replacement)
The mindset shift that ensures long-term success:
- AI enhances but doesn't replace thinking
- Struggle and effort are essential for learning
- AI helps you understand, not just complete
- You remain the driver of your education

## üèÜ Final Project: "My AI Learning System"

**Overview:**
Students create a comprehensive personal AI learning system demonstrating mastery of all techniques learned throughout the course.

**Components:**
1. **Personal Prompt Library** (40% of grade)
   - Minimum 15 prompts across 3+ subjects
   - Organized by category and purpose
   - Includes variations and notes on effectiveness

2. **Real Assignment Application** (40% of grade)
   - Select a complex current assignment
   - Apply integrated techniques to complete it
   - Document the process and AI interactions
   - Reflect on what techniques worked best and why

3. **Ethical Use Statement** (20% of grade)
   - Personal guidelines for AI use
   - Examples of appropriate vs. inappropriate use
   - Plan for citing AI assistance
   - Commitment to academic integrity

**Deliverables:**

### Common Challenges

**"I don't have enough prompts for a library"**
‚Üí Review Classes 1-3 materials, adapt provided templates, create variations

**"My assignment isn't complex enough"**
‚Üí Apply techniques to planning, outlining, or deeper understanding beyond the assignment

**"I'm confused about what's ethical"**
‚Üí Use the "Learning vs. Shortcutting" test: Does this help me understand or bypass learning?

**"I won't remember all this after the course"**
‚Üí That's why you're building a library! These become your resources going forward
