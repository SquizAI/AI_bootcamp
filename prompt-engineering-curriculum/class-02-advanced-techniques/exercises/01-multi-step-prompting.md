## General Tips for Multi-Step Prompting Success

1. **Number Your Steps:** Make it easy for the AI to follow your structure
2. **Be Specific About What You Want:** "Explain why" is better than "Explain"
3. **Build Complexity Gradually:** Start simple, add details in later steps
4. **Ask for Verification:** Include steps that check the work (especially in math)
5. **Connect Steps:** Show how each step leads to the next
6. **Include Context:** Tell the AI your grade level and subject area
7. **Request Clear Format:** Ask for numbered answers, bullet points, or structured text
