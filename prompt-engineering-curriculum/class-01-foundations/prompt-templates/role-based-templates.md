## Common Mistakes When Using Templates

### Avoid These:

❌ **Filling in blanks without thinking**
Templates are starting points, not mad libs

❌ **Using same template for everything**
Different needs require different approaches

❌ **Not including your specific context**
Generic = generic responses

❌ **Forgetting to specify format**
You might get help, but not in the way you need

✅ **Do this instead:**
- Think about what you really need
- Choose template that matches
- Customize thoroughly
- Refine based on response
