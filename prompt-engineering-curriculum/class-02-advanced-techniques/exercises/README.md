## How to Use These Exercises

### For Students:
1. **Start with your grade level:** Each exercise has 7th, 9th, and 11th-grade versions
2. **Read the scenario:** Understand what you're trying to accomplish
3. **Study the examples:** See what good vs. poor prompts look like
4. **Write your own:** Practice creating prompts for real situations
5. **Reflect:** Use reflection questions to deepen understanding

### For Teachers:
1. **Assign by grade level:** Match exercises to your students' level
2. **Use as homework:** Assign students to complete practice prompts
3. **Class activity:** Work through examples together, have students write prompts in class
4. **Scaffolding:** Start with single-technique exercises, move to combined techniques
5. **Assessment:** Have students submit their prompts and explain their choices

### Suggested Progression:
**Week 1:** 01-multi-step-prompting (foundational)
**Week 2:** 02-few-shot-prompting (pattern recognition)
**Week 3:** 03-negative-prompting (constraints and boundaries)
**Week 4:** Combined techniques (using templates from advanced-templates.md)
