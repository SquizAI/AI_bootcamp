**Advanced (4):** Shows strong application of techniques; clear evidence of learning

**Proficient (3):** Meets expectations; demonstrates competent skill use

**Developing (2):** Approaching expectations; shows understanding but needs refinement

**Beginning (1):** Below expectations; incomplete understanding or application

---

## Criterion 1: Prompt Quality & Completeness

### What This Measures
Can you write prompts with all essential components? Do your prompts effectively get you the help you need?

### Exemplary (5)
- All prompts include strong role, context, task, and format components
- Constraints are thoughtfully included and appropriate
- Prompts are sophisticated and well-articulated
- Complexity matches difficulty of task
- Evidence that you tested and refined prompts

**Example:** "Act as a biology tutor for a student who understands photosynthesis conceptually but struggles with the ATP production cycle. Walk me through the process step-by-step, explaining why each step happens, not just what happens. Use analogies to everyday energy uses (phone battery, getting tired after running, etc.) and help me build mental models, not memorize steps."

### Advanced (4)
- Most prompts include all four components clearly
- Constraints are present and appropriate
- Prompts are well-written and specific
- Good match between prompt complexity and task
- Some evidence of testing/refinement

### Proficient (3)
- All prompts include role, context, and task
- Format and constraints present in most prompts
- Prompts clearly communicate needs
- Appropriate complexity for tasks
- Minimal evidence of refinement

### Developing (2)
- Some components missing from prompts
- Constraints vague or absent in several prompts
- Prompts could be more specific
- Some mismatch between complexity and task
- Little evidence of iteration

### Beginning (1)
- Multiple components missing
- Prompts are vague or incomplete
- Constraints not used
- Doesn't match task appropriately
- No evidence of refinement

## Criterion 2: Evidence of Learning & Skill Development

### What This Measures
Can you apply what you learned in class? Do you show growth in your prompting abilities?

### Exemplary (5)
- Clear demonstration of all techniques from curriculum (role-based, multi-step, few-shot, constraints)
- Sophisticated combinations of techniques
- Shows meta-awareness of why techniques work
- Explains relationships between prompt quality and results
- Prompts show increasing sophistication across project

**Example:** "I started with basic role prompts (Class 1), but as I got more complex assignments, I realized I needed multi-step structure (Class 2). For my essay brainstorming, I added few-shot examples because I found that showed better results than explaining what I wanted. By the end, I was combining all three with strategic constraints."

### Advanced (4)
- Demonstrates multiple techniques from class
- Good combinations of techniques
- Shows understanding of when to use different approaches
- Clear application of Class 1-2 material
- Some evidence of building on techniques

### Proficient (3)
- Demonstrates key techniques from class
- Uses at least 2-3 different techniques
- Shows understanding of basic principles
- Applies Class 1 and some Class 2 material
- Minimal technique combination

### Developing (2)
- Demonstrates some techniques
- Relies heavily on one or two approaches
- Understanding of techniques is partial
- Mostly Class 1 material
- Limited combination of techniques

### Beginning (1)
- Minimal technique demonstration
- Heavy reliance on one approach
- Limited understanding of why techniques work
- Below Class 1 expectations
- No technique combination

- Shows how prompts helped with real challenges
- Evidence that you'll continue using these skills

**Example:** Include screenshots showing prompts used for actual math problems, essay writing, science concepts, history analysis. Include brief notes like "This prompt helped me understand why the quadratic formula works, not just how to use it" or "Instead of just getting answers, I now get the thinking process."

### Advanced (4)
- Most prompts applied to real assignments
- Clear connection between prompt quality and better help
- 2-3 different subjects
- Shows real academic benefit
- Likely to use skills in future

### Proficient (3)
- All prompts based on real work
- Connection between prompts and academic help is clear
- Multiple subjects included
- Shows genuine academic application
- Good foundation for future use

### Developing (2)
- Most prompts based on real work
- Connection to academic benefit is somewhat unclear
- Limited subject variety
- Application feels somewhat forced
- Uncertain about future use

### Beginning (1)
- Prompts seem hypothetical rather than real
- Weak connection to actual academic needs
- Single subject or generic examples
- Application doesn't feel authentic
- No indication of practical future use

Can you recognize when a prompt isn't working and improve it? Do you show a growth mindset about your craft?

### Exemplary (5)
- Shows multiple iterations of prompts
- Clear before-and-after comparisons
- Explains specifically why changes were made
- Demonstrates problem-solving when prompts fail
- Shows learning from failures

**Example:** Show first attempt at a prompt, explain what didn't work ("The response was too technical for my grade level"), show revised version with specific changes ("Added: explain like I'm in 8th grade"), show improved result. Include 2-3 examples of this iterative process.

### Advanced (4)
- Shows iteration for most prompts
- Explains changes made
- Demonstrates refinement process
- Shows learning from adjustments
- Clear improvement in later prompts

### Proficient (3)
- Shows some iteration
- Explains changes for key prompts
- Demonstrates refinement attempts
- Shows at least one clear improvement
- Later prompts build on earlier learning

### Developing (2)
- Minimal iteration shown
- Explanations vague about why changes were made
- One or two refinement examples
- Learning from adjustments unclear
- Limited evidence of improvement

### Beginning (1)
- No iteration shown
- Prompts presented as final versions
- No explanation of refinement
- No evidence of learning from attempts
- No improvement across project

## Criterion 5: Quality & Depth of Reflection

### What This Measures
Can you think critically about your prompting? Do you understand what worked, what didn't, and why?

### Exemplary (5)
- Thoughtful analysis of what worked and why
- Honest assessment of limitations
- Clear connections to learning objectives
- Discusses specific techniques and their effectiveness
- Provides actionable insights for future improvement

**Example:** "I realized that role-based prompting alone wasn't enough for complex analysis. When I added multi-step structure for my history essay, I got much better help understanding cause-and-effect relationships. Next time, I'll start with multi-step for anything with multiple parts. What surprised me is how much constraints matterâ€”when I added 'don't give me the answer' to my math prompts, I actually learned more because I was working through the thinking process myself."

- Discusses technique effectiveness
- Shows metacognitive awareness
- Some insights about future use

### Proficient (3)
- Adequate reflection on what worked
- Addresses some challenges

- Shows thinking about effectiveness
- Some forward-looking insights

### Developing (2)
- Surface-level reflection
- Mentions what worked but lacks depth
