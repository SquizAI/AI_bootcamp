**Step 2:** Write your complete prompt

**Pro Tip:** Science often benefits from analogies or real-world examples. Consider requesting this in your format!

**Step 3:** Test in Gemini

**Step 4:** Refine if needed
Common refinements:
- "Explain that more simply"
- "Can you use an everyday analogy?"
- "Give me a specific example"

- Specific challenge you're facing
- What you DON'T want (e.g., "don't rewrite it for me")

**Step 3:** Test and evaluate

**Important:** Good writing help explains HOW to improve, not just fixes things for you!

- Need: Understanding different methods of constitutional interpretation

### Your Task

**Step 1:** Choose a history-focused role
Consider:
- History teacher
- Subject expert (US history, world history, government)
- Teaching style preference

**Step 2:** Craft your prompt

**History Tip:** Include what perspective or skills you need (analysis, comparison, cause-and-effect, chronology, etc.)

**Step 3:** Test and refine

## Exercise 1E: Cross-Subject Application

### Scenario
Use prompt engineering for a subject we haven't covered yet!

**Choose a different subject you're studying:**
- Foreign language
- Art
- Music
- Computer science
- Economics
- Psychology
- Health
- Physical education theory
- Any elective

### Your Task

**Step 1:** Identify what role would help
Think creatively! Roles can be:
- Subject teachers
- Practitioners (artist, musician, programmer)
- Coaches
- Native speakers (for language)
- Industry experts

**Step 2:** Create a prompt for a real question you have in this subject

**Step 3:** Test it!

**Challenge:** This is your chance to apply the technique to something uniquely yours!

## Exercise 1F: Role Comparison Challenge

### Scenario
Test how different roles change the response to the SAME question.

**Pick any topic you're currently studying**

### Your Task

**Step 1:** Write the same basic question three times, but assign THREE DIFFERENT ROLES

**Example for geometry:**

**Version 1:**
```
Act as a patient math tutor. I'm learning about the Pythagorean theorem...
```

**Version 2:**
```
Act as a Socratic teacher who asks questions instead of giving answers. I'm learning about the Pythagorean theorem...
```

**Version 3:**
```
Act as a real-world engineer who uses geometry daily. I'm learning about the Pythagorean theorem...
```

**Step 2:** Test all three prompts

**Step 3:** Compare responses
- How did the roles change the answers?
- Which was most helpful for you?
- When might you want each type of response?

**Key Learning:** Different roles serve different learning needs!

## Extension Activities

### For Fast Finishers

**Activity 1: Create a Role Menu**
Make a personal "role menu" for your main subjects:
- Math: [preferred role and why]
- Science: [preferred role and why]
- English: [preferred role and why]
- History: [preferred role and why]
- Other: [preferred role and why]

**Activity 2: Help a Classmate**
Partner with someone and help them improve their prompt by:
- Suggesting a better role
- Asking what context they should add
- Testing their refined prompt together

**Activity 3: Advanced Role Combinations**
Try combining multiple roles:
- "Act as both a history teacher and a debate coach..."
- "You are a writing tutor who specializes in helping science students..."
- "Pretend you're a study partner who's good at both math and explaining things clearly..."

## Self-Assessment Checklist

After completing these exercises, can you:

- [ ] Identify when role-based prompting would be helpful
- [ ] Choose an appropriate role for different subjects
- [ ] Write a complete prompt with all four components
- [ ] Get a response that's more helpful than a generic question
- [ ] Refine prompts when the first attempt isn't quite right
- [ ] Explain to someone else why role-based prompting works

**If you checked all boxes, you've mastered the basics! If not, that's okay—keep practicing!**

## Reflection Questions

Take 2-3 minutes to think about:

1. **What surprised you** about how roles changed AI responses?

2. **Which role worked best for you** and why?

3. **How will you use role-based prompting** with your actual homework this week?

4. **What questions do you still have** about role-based prompting?

---

## Tips for Success

**Do:**
✅ Experiment with different roles
✅ Be specific about what you need
✅ Include grade level and context
✅ Refine based on responses
✅ Save prompts that work well

**Don't:**
❌ Use roles that are too vague ("expert" vs. "biology teacher")
❌ Forget to include context after the role
❌ Expect perfection on first try
❌ Give up if one role doesn't work—try another!

**Remember:** You're learning a skill. Like any skill, it improves with practice!
