# Class 3: Gemini AI Studio Deep Dive + Meta-Prompting

## Overview

This is the third session in a 4-class prompt engineering curriculum. Having mastered individual prompting techniques in Classes 1 and 2, students now learn to build reusable systems using Gemini AI Studio and meta-prompting strategies. The focus shifts from creating one-off prompts to designing prompt systems that can be saved, refined, and reused across subjects and contexts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this 90-minute class, students will be able to:

1. **Navigate Gemini AI Studio** and understand its key features vs. regular Gemini
2. **Create and use system instructions** to establish persistent AI behavior across conversations
3. **Select appropriate Gemini models** (2.5 Pro, Flash, Flash-Lite) for different tasks
4. **Apply meta-prompting techniques** to create prompts that generate better prompts
5. **Build and organize prompt libraries** for different subjects and use cases
6. **Save and reuse effective prompt configurations** in AI Studio
7. **Understand structured outputs** and when to use JSON mode
8. **Design scalable prompt systems** rather than one-off interactions

## Key Concepts

### What is Gemini AI Studio?

Gemini AI Studio is the advanced interface for Google's Gemini AI that provides:
- System instructions (persistent prompt context)
- Model selection and configuration
- Saved chat history and prompt templates
- Structured output modes (JSON)
- Long context window (1M tokens)
- Multimodal capabilities
- Vibe Code feature for creative prompting

**Regular Gemini** is great for quick questions and conversations.
**AI Studio** is for building reusable systems and advanced applications.

### System Instructions

System instructions are special prompts that:
- Apply to ALL messages in a conversation
- Define the AI's persistent role and behavior
- Set constraints, tone, and approach upfront
- Save you from repeating context every time
- Can be saved and reused across multiple chats

Think of system instructions as "programming" the AI's personality and expertise for a specific purpose.

### Meta-Prompting

Meta-prompting is the practice of using AI to:
- Generate better prompts for specific tasks
- Analyze and improve existing prompts
- Create prompt templates for common scenarios
- Design custom prompt systems for your needs

Instead of just using AI to solve problems, you use AI to help you communicate with AI better!

### Building vs. Using

**Class 1 & 2 focus:** Using prompts (getting help with homework)
**Class 3 focus:** Building systems (creating reusable tools)

This shift from consumer to creator is a major milestone in AI literacy.

## What Makes This Class Different

### Shift in Mindset

**Classes 1-2:** "How do I get help with THIS homework problem?"
**Class 3:** "How do I create a SYSTEM that helps with ALL my homework?"

### From Tactical to Strategic

Students move from:
- Individual prompts → Prompt templates
- One-time use → Reusable systems
- Ad-hoc help → Organized libraries
- Trial and error → Systematic design

### Empowerment

By the end of this class, students aren't just AI users—they're AI system builders. They can create custom learning tools tailored to their exact needs.

- Be able to create meta-prompts for new situations
- Know how to select appropriate models for different tasks
- Demonstrate shift from using prompts to building prompt systems
- Feel confident creating custom AI learning tools

## Important Notes

### Academic Integrity

System instructions and prompt libraries should still emphasize learning, not answer-getting:
- Include constraints about not doing work for students
- Focus on understanding and skill-building
- Maintain Socratic questioning approaches
- Document when and how AI assistance was used

### Technical Requirements

- Gemini AI Studio requires a Google account
- Works best on laptops/tablets (not phones)
- Stable internet connection needed
- Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari recommended)

### Time Management

This class is dense with new concepts. If time runs short:
- Prioritize system instructions (most immediately useful)
- Can reduce meta-prompting time
- Ensure students create at least one saved configuration
- Extend hands-on practice as homework if needed
