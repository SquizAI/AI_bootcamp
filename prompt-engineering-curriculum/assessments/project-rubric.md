- Complexity matches difficulty of task
- Evidence that you tested and refined prompts

**Example:**
> "Act as a biology tutor for a student who understands photosynthesis conceptually but struggles with the ATP production cycle. Walk me through the process step-by-step, explaining why each step happens, not just what happens. Use analogies to everyday energy uses (phone battery, getting tired after running, etc.) and help me build mental models, not memorize steps."

## Growth Areas to Consider

<div align="center">

**Identify Your Next Steps**

</div>

After completing your self-assessment, identify 1-3 specific areas for improvement:

### If Prompt Quality is low:

- Review the five criteria (role, context, task, format, constraints)
- Practice including all components in every prompt
- Use the self-assessment rubric for each new prompt

### If Evidence of Learning is low:

- Explicitly try different techniques
- Document which techniques you use
- Reflect on why certain techniques work better

### If Real Application is low:

- Use prompts for your actual homework this week
- Document the results
- Compare prompt quality to help received

### If Iteration is low:

- Take one prompt and create three versions
- Document what you changed each time
- Explain why each change improved the result

### If Reflection is low:

- Spend more time thinking about why things worked
- Connect your experiences to specific techniques
- Write about both successes and challenges

### If Presentation is low:

- Create a clear structure before you start
- Label everything clearly
- Ask someone to review for clarity

---

<div align="center">

## Remember

This rubric values growth and learning, not perfection.

- Your portfolio doesn't need to be perfect
- Evidence of iteration and learning is more valuable than flawless final products
- Honest reflection about challenges is more meaningful than claiming everything was easy
- Your real prompts matter more than hypothetical examples
- Growth over time is what matters most

### You've learned a valuable skill. This portfolio should celebrate that journey.
