# Writing Prompting Guide

## Introduction

This guide will help you use AI effectively as a writing partner while maintaining your authentic voice and developing your writing skills. The goal is not to have AI write for you, but to help you become a better writer who can generate ideas, organize thoughts, refine arguments, and polish your work independently.

## Core Principles for Writing Prompts

1. **Use AI as a writing coach, not a ghostwriter** - Get guidance, not completed work
2. **Maintain your authentic voice** - Your ideas, experiences, and style should shine through
3. **Focus on the writing process, not just the product** - Develop skills that transfer to all writing
4. **Ask for feedback and suggestions, not replacement text** - Learn by revising your own work
5. **Build your writing skills progressively** - Each assignment is an opportunity to improve
6. **Be transparent about AI use** - Follow your school's policies and cite AI assistance appropriately

## Writing-Specific Prompt Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Idea Generator
```
"I need to write about [topic/prompt]. I have some initial thoughts: [your ideas].
Help me brainstorm by: 1) Expanding on my ideas, 2) Suggesting angles I haven't
considered, 3) Asking me questions that help me think deeper about the topic.
Don't write the essay - help me develop MY ideas."
```

**When to use:** Beginning stages when generating and exploring ideas

### Pattern 2: The Structure Builder
```
"I want to write [type of essay] about [topic]. I have these main points:
[your points]. Help me organize these into a logical structure. What's the
most effective order? What might be missing? How should I transition between
ideas? Give me an outline structure, not full paragraphs."
```

**When to use:** Organizing ideas into a coherent structure

### Pattern 3: The Thesis Sharpener
```
"My working thesis is: [your thesis]. Is this specific enough? Does it make
a clear argument? How could I make it stronger or more focused? Give me 2-3
alternative versions that sharpen my main idea."
```

**When to use:** Developing and refining your central argument

### Pattern 4: The Evidence Evaluator
```
"I'm arguing that [claim] and I want to use this evidence: [your evidence].
Does this evidence effectively support my claim? What questions might a reader
have? What additional evidence would strengthen my argument? How should I
explain the connection?"
```

**When to use:** Evaluating and strengthening your supporting evidence

### Pattern 5: The Revision Guide
```
"Here's a paragraph from my essay: [your paragraph]. Don't rewrite it - instead,
give me specific feedback: What works well? What's unclear? Where could I be
more specific? How's the flow? What revision strategies should I try?"
```

**When to use:** Getting constructive feedback on your own writing

### Pattern 6: The Style Checker
```
"Read this passage from my essay: [passage]. Does it match the [formal/casual/
academic] tone I'm aiming for? Are there places where I'm too wordy or too
vague? Point out issues but don't rewrite - I want to practice fixing them."
```

**When to use:** Improving tone, clarity, and conciseness

---

## Writing by Stage

## Stage 1: Pre-Writing and Brainstorming

### Understanding the Assignment:
```
"I have this writing assignment: [assignment prompt]. Help me understand what's
being asked by: 1) Identifying key verbs (analyze, compare, argue, etc.),
2) Clarifying what the teacher expects, 3) Suggesting questions I should answer
in my essay. What type of essay is this?"
```

### Exploring Ideas:
```
"I'm writing about [topic] and I'm interested in [specific angle]. Ask me 5-7
questions that help me explore this topic more deeply. Make them questions that
require thinking, not just facts."
```

### Finding Your Angle:
```
"Everyone writing about [topic] will probably say [common approach]. How can I
approach this differently? What unique perspective could I bring based on my
experience with [relevant experience]? What surprising connection could I make?"
```

### Freewriting Prompts:
```
"I'm stuck getting started on [topic]. Give me three creative freewriting prompts
that help me explore different aspects of this topic. I'll write for 5 minutes
on each, then come back to discuss what emerged."
```

---

## Stage 2: Outlining and Organization

### Creating Basic Structure:
```
"For my essay on [topic] with thesis [thesis], help me create an outline
structure. I need [number] body paragraphs. For each paragraph, help me
identify: 1) The main point, 2) What evidence I need, 3) How it supports
my thesis. Don't write sentences - just help me organize ideas."
```

### Checking Logical Flow:
```
"Here's my outline: [outline]. Does each point logically lead to the next?
Where might a reader get confused? Are there gaps in my logic? What
transitions will I need? Point out structural issues."
```

### Developing Topic Sentences:
```
"My paragraph will be about [main point]. Help me write 2-3 possible topic
sentences that: 1) Clearly state the paragraph's main idea, 2) Connect to
my thesis, 3) Set up what will follow. Which is strongest and why?"
```

---

## Stage 3: Drafting

### Writing Introductions:
```
"I need to write an introduction for my essay about [topic] with this thesis:
[thesis]. Describe three different hooks I could use (question, anecdote,
surprising fact, etc.). Don't write the intro - explain the strategies and
let me draft it myself."
```

### Developing Body Paragraphs:
```
"I'm writing a body paragraph about [main point]. I have this evidence: [evidence].
Guide me in developing this paragraph: 1) How should I introduce the evidence?
2) What analysis is needed? 3) How do I connect it back to my thesis? Give me
a strategy, not a finished paragraph."
```

### Creating Effective Conclusions:
```
"My essay argues [thesis]. What are three effective strategies for concluding
this type of essay? What should I avoid? How can I end memorably without just
repeating my intro? Explain the strategies - don't write it for me."
```

### Maintaining Voice:
```
"I want my essay to sound like me, not like a robot. Read this paragraph:
[paragraph]. Does it sound natural and authentic? Where does it sound too
formal or too casual? How can I maintain appropriate tone while still sounding
like myself?"
```

---

## Stage 4: Revising and Editing

### Getting Feedback on Content:
```
"Here's my rough draft: [draft]. Don't edit grammar or rewrite sentences.
Instead, give me feedback on: 1) Is my thesis clear and well-supported?
2) Are my paragraphs organized logically? 3) Where do I need more evidence
or explanation? 4) What's strong and should stay? 5) What needs significant
revision?"
```

### Strengthening Arguments:
```
"I argue that [claim] using this evidence: [evidence]. Play devil's advocate:
What would someone who disagrees say? What counterarguments should I address?
How can I make my argument more convincing? What holes exist in my reasoning?"
```

### Improving Clarity:
```
"This paragraph isn't as clear as I want it to be: [paragraph]. What's confusing?
Where am I being too vague? What needs more explanation? Point out the problems
and suggest revision strategies, but don't rewrite it."
```

### Enhancing Transitions:
```
"Here are two consecutive paragraphs from my essay: [paragraphs]. What's the
logical connection between them? What transition would help the reader follow
my thinking? Suggest some transition strategies appropriate for this relationship."
```

### Eliminating Redundancy:
```
"I think I'm being repetitive or wordy in this section: [section]. Where am
I saying the same thing multiple times? What can be cut without losing meaning?
How can I say this more concisely? Point out the issues without rewriting."
```

---

## Stage 5: Polishing and Proofreading

### Checking Grammar and Mechanics:
```
"Proofread this paragraph: [paragraph]. Identify errors in: grammar, punctuation,
spelling, and sentence structure. For each error, explain the rule I'm breaking
and how to fix it. This helps me learn, not just fix this one piece."
```

### Varying Sentence Structure:
```
"Read these sentences: [3-4 sentences]. Are they too similar in structure?
Do they all start the same way? Suggest how I could vary them for better
rhythm and flow, but let me do the actual rewriting."
```

### Checking Word Choice:
```
"In this paragraph, identify: 1) Overused words, 2) Unnecessarily complex words,
3) Vague words that need to be more specific. For each, suggest better
alternatives and explain why they're better."
```

### Final Polish:
```
"This is my final draft before submission: [essay]. Do a final check for:
1) Consistency in tone and tense, 2) Formatting issues, 3) Any remaining
awkward phrasing, 4) Places where I could strengthen word choice. Flag
issues but don't rewrite."
```

## Maintaining Your Authentic Voice

### What Is Voice?
Your voice is the unique way you express ideas - your word choice, sentence rhythm, personality, and perspective. It's what makes your writing sound like YOU, not like a generic essay or someone else.

### Protecting Your Voice When Using AI:

**DO:**
- Use AI to clarify your own ideas, not generate new ones
- Ask AI to help you say what you mean more clearly
- Request feedback that helps you improve YOUR writing
- Use AI suggestions as options to consider, not commands to follow
- Read your work aloud - if it doesn't sound like you, revise

**DON'T:**
- Accept AI-written sentences without making them your own
- Use vocabulary or phrasing that doesn't feel natural to you
- Let AI change your meaning or perspective
- Use expressions or references you wouldn't normally use
- Forget that the essay should represent YOUR thinking

### Testing Your Voice:
```
"Read this paragraph: [paragraph]. Does this sound like it was written by a
real person or by AI? What makes it sound authentic or generic? If it sounds
too formal or robotic, what could I change to make it sound more like me while
still being appropriate for [assignment type]?"
```

### Finding Your Voice:
```
"I want my writing to sound more like me. Here's an example of my casual writing
[example] and here's my attempt at this essay [example]. The essay doesn't sound
like me. How can I maintain an appropriate [formal/academic/personal] tone while
still sounding authentic? What specifically makes writing sound genuine?"
```

## Common Writing Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: The AI Ghostwriter
**Problem:** Having AI write large portions of your essay
**Solution:** Only ask AI for feedback, strategies, and guidance - never completed paragraphs or sentences to use directly
**Better Prompt:** "Don't write this for me, but help me understand the strategy I should use"

### Pitfall 2: The Vocabulary Inflator
**Problem:** Using complex words you found through AI that aren't natural to you
**Solution:** Ask for clarification and simpler alternatives, use words you understand
**Better Prompt:** "Explain this in simpler terms that a [your grade] student would naturally use"

### Pitfall 3: The Direct Copy
**Problem:** Copying AI-generated text into your essay
**Solution:** Use AI suggestions as starting points, then rewrite in your own words
**Better Prompt:** "Give me the idea and strategy, but let me write it myself"

### Pitfall 4: The Idea Outsourcer
**Problem:** Asking AI for your arguments and ideas rather than developing your own
**Solution:** Share your ideas first, then ask AI to help you develop them
**Better Prompt:** "Here's what I think: [your ideas]. Help me develop these further"

### Pitfall 5: The Grammar Robot
**Problem:** Accepting every grammar suggestion without understanding why
**Solution:** Ask for explanations of grammar rules so you learn
**Better Prompt:** "Explain why this is wrong and what rule applies, so I can learn"

### Pitfall 6: The Revision Avoider
**Problem:** Treating first drafts as final because AI helped
**Solution:** Use AI as part of your revision process, not a replacement for it
**Better Prompt:** "What revision strategies should I use on this draft?"

### Pitfall 7: The Dependent Writer
**Problem:** Becoming unable to write without AI assistance
**Solution:** Sometimes write without AI to maintain your independent skills
**Better Approach:** Write first drafts yourself, then use AI for revision feedback

- Some allow certain uses but not others
- When in doubt, ask your teacher

**What to Cite:**
```
"How should I cite AI assistance in my essay? My school's policy says [policy].
I used AI to [specific uses]. What's the appropriate way to acknowledge this?
Should it be in a note, in my bibliography, or somewhere else?"
```

**Transparent Use:**
- Tell your teacher if you're unsure about appropriate AI use
- Document how you used AI if required
- Never claim AI-written work as your own
- Use AI to enhance your skills, not replace them

---

## Quick Reference: Prompt Starters by Need

**When starting an essay:**
"I need to write [type of essay] about [topic]. Help me brainstorm by asking me questions that help me explore different angles."

## Final Tips for Success

1. **Always write your own first draft** - AI can't capture your unique ideas and voice
2. **Use AI for feedback, not replacement** - Improve your writing, don't outsource it
3. **Ask "why" questions** - Understand the reasoning behind suggestions
4. **Read everything aloud** - If it doesn't sound like you, revise it
5. **Keep a writing journal** - Track strategies you learn and want to remember
6. **Practice without AI sometimes** - Maintain your independent writing skills
7. **Focus on the process** - Each essay makes you a better writer
8. **Be honest about AI use** - Follow your school's policies and be transparent
9. **Make it yours** - Never submit anything you didn't write or don't understand
10. **Trust your voice** - Your ideas and perspective have value

## Conclusion

Using AI effectively for writing means treating it as a coach who helps you improve, not a service that writes for you. The best writers use AI to:
- Generate and explore ideas
- Organize complex thoughts
- Get feedback on their work
- Learn new strategies
- Refine and polish their writing
- Develop their unique voice

Remember: Every essay is an opportunity to become a better writer. The skills you develop now - critical thinking, clear communication, effective argumentation, and authentic voice - will serve you throughout your education and career.

Write with integrity, revise with purpose, and always make it authentically yours.

Happy writing!
