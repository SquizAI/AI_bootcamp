# Skill Checklist: Prompt Engineering Progression

## How to Use This Checklist

This checklist tracks the skills you're building throughout the 4-class curriculum. It uses "I can" statements so you can assess your own learning.

**How to assess yourself:**
- If you can do it independently and confidently: Check the box and mark it SOLID
- If you can do it with help: Check it but mark it DEVELOPING
- If you haven't tried yet: Leave it blank

**Check this at the start of each class to see what you're building on. Check it again at the end to see your growth.**

## Areas of Difficulty (Normal!)

**Many students find these challenging:**

### Constraints
- "I'm not sure what to prevent"
- Solution: Start with academic integrity constraints, then branch out

### Few-Shot
- "My examples don't seem to work"
- Solution: Make format EXACTLY the same across all examples

### Multi-Step
- "Should I use one prompt or chain them?"
- Solution: Try both and see what works; it varies by task

### Combining Techniques
- "This is getting too complicated"
- Solution: Start with basics (role + context), add one advanced technique at a time

### Meta-Prompting
- "I don't know how to ask AI about prompts"
- Solution: Try: "Help me write a better prompt for..." or "Evaluate this prompt and suggest improvements"

**These are ALL learnable. Keep practicing.**

## Celebrating Your Progress

**Early wins to celebrate:**
- Writing your first role-based prompt
- Getting a significantly better response with more context
- Recognizing that your constraint prevented an unhelpful response
- Seeing a prompt work better after revision
- Successfully using multi-step for complex work

**Later wins to celebrate:**
- Creating a few-shot prompt that works perfectly
- Teaching someone else a technique
- Realizing you don't need templates anymore
- Setting up a personalized AI Studio project

## Moving Forward

After Class 4, you'll have completed the formal curriculum, but your learning continues:

- Keep using your personal systems
- Keep refining based on results
- Help peers with techniques you've learned
- Explore advanced features as they're released
- Adapt techniques to new tools as they emerge
- Maintain ethical standards as you grow more powerful
- Continue reflecting on what works

**This checklist will be part of your learning toolkit forever. You can come back to it whenever you want to assess where you are and what to work on next.**

## Key Principle

**You don't need to check everything to be successful.**

- Perfect is not the goal
- Growth is the goal
- Using these skills in real work matters more than checking boxes
- Your reflection matters more than your scores
- The fact that you're learning this skill matters

**You've got this. Keep going.**
