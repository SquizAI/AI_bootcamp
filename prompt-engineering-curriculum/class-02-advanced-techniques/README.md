## Key Concepts

<div align="center">

### Technique Breakdown

</div>

### 1. Multi-Step (Chain-of-Thought) Prompting

Breaking complex problems into sequential steps where each step builds on the previous one. Essential for:
- Complex math problems
- Research tasks
- Multi-part assignments
- Analysis requiring multiple perspectives

**Badge:** [![Multi-Step](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Multi%20Step%20Thinking-7C3AED?style=flat-square&logo=link)](.)

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting

Providing examples in the prompt to show the AI the pattern you want. According to Google's documentation (Oct 2025), few-shot prompts are **highly recommended** and often more effective than lengthy instructions.

**Badge:** [![Few-Shot](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Few%20Shot%20Examples-7C3AED?style=flat-square&logo=lightbulb)](.)

### 3. Zero-Shot Prompting

Prompting without examples, relying on clear instructions alone. Useful when examples are hard to create or when exploring new problem types.

**Badge:** [![Zero-Shot](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Zero%20Shot%20Direct-7C3AED?style=flat-square&logo=target)](.)

### 4. Negative Prompting

Explicitly telling the AI what **NOT** to do. Crucial for:
- Maintaining academic integrity
- Avoiding unwanted formats
- Preventing oversimplification
- Keeping responses on-topic

**Badge:** [![Constraints](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Constraint%20Engineering-7C3AED?style=flat-square&logo=lock)](.)

### 5. Prompt Chaining

Connecting multiple prompts where the output of one becomes the input of the next. Powerful for complex, multi-stage tasks.

**Badge:** [![Chaining](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prompt%20Chaining-7C3AED?style=flat-square&logo=link)](.)

### Featured: Stanford's AI Productivity Guide

üì∫ **[Stanford's Practical Guide to 10x Your AI Productivity | Jeremy Utley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMOmmnjy3sE)** (25 min)

Stanford's AI & Creativity expert breaks down the exact techniques you'll learn in this class:
- Context Engineering
- Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- Few-Shot Prompting
- Role-based techniques

**Bonus:** Jeremy has a great sense of humor and makes advanced concepts accessible. His insight about treating AI like an "eager intern" rather than a search engine is game-changing!
