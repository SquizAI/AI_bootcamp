# üìö Prompt Engineering Assessment - Student Quick Start Guide

## What Is This?

This is an **interactive AI tutor** that will test your prompt engineering skills! You'll paste a special "meta-prompt" into Google Gemini, and it will become your personal tutor that:
- ‚úÖ Teaches you 7 different prompt techniques
- ‚úÖ Asks you to create prompts for each technique
- ‚úÖ Gives you feedback on every prompt you write
- ‚úÖ Lets you revise to earn more points
- ‚úÖ Grades you out of 100 points at the end

## üéØ What You'll Be Tested On

You'll create prompts demonstrating these 7 skills:

1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Assigning expert roles to AI
2. **Context Engineering** - Providing detailed background information
3. **Multi-Step Prompting** - Breaking complex tasks into steps
4. **Few-Shot Prompting** - Teaching through examples
5. **Constraint-Based Prompting** - Setting boundaries and limits

### Step 7: Complete All 7 Sections
- For each section, the tutor will:
  1. Explain the technique
  2. Show you an example
  3. Give you a challenge
  4. Evaluate your prompt
  5. Offer you a chance to revise
  6. Give you a score
- Work through all 7 sections

### Step 8: Get Your Final Report
- After Section 7, the tutor will calculate your total score
- You'll get a detailed performance report
- Read it carefully - it tells you what you're good at and what to practice!

### Step 9: Save Your Work
**VERY IMPORTANT:** You need to save your conversation to submit!

**Option 1: Take Screenshots**
- Scroll through your entire conversation
- Take screenshots of each section
- Make sure you capture all your prompts and all the tutor's feedback

**Option 2: Copy the Conversation**
- Scroll to the top of your conversation
- Select all the text
- Copy it and paste into a Google Doc
- Save the document

### Step 10: Submit to Your Teacher
- Submit your screenshots OR your Google Doc
- Make sure your final report with your score is included!

## ‚è±Ô∏è How Long Will This Take?

- **Most students:** 45-60 minutes
- **If you work quickly:** 35-45 minutes
- **If you take time to revise:** 60-75 minutes

**Tip:** Don't rush! Taking time to create good prompts is better than rushing through.

## üí° Tips for Success

### Before You Start
- ‚úÖ Make sure you've completed **Class 1** and **Class 2** from the curriculum
- ‚úÖ Review your notes on **R.C.T.F.** (Role, Context, Task, Format)
- ‚úÖ Have your prompt templates handy for reference
- ‚úÖ Find a quiet place where you can focus

### During the Assessment
- ‚úÖ **Read carefully** - The tutor gives specific requirements for each section
- ‚úÖ **Be specific** - Vague prompts get lower scores
- ‚úÖ **Use real examples** - Base your prompts on real schoolwork
- ‚úÖ **Take revisions** - You can earn back points! Use that opportunity
- ‚úÖ **Show your learning** - Include academic integrity constraints
- ‚úÖ **Don't rush** - Quality > speed

### For Each Prompt You Write
Ask yourself:
- ‚ùì Did I include a clear role?
- ‚ùì Did I provide detailed context?
- ‚ùì Is my task specific and clear?
- ‚ùì Did I request a format?
- ‚ùì Would this actually help me learn (not just get an answer)?

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå Being too vague ("Help me with math")
- ‚ùå Not including context about your level
- ‚ùå Forgetting to set constraints
- ‚ùå Asking AI to do the work for you
- ‚ùå Rushing through without reading feedback
- ‚ùå Not taking revision opportunities

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "The AI tutor isn't responding correctly"
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE meta-prompt (it's long!)
- Try starting a new conversation in Gemini
- Re-paste the meta-prompt

### "I'm stuck on a section"
- Read the tutor's example carefully
- Think about real homework you've done
- Ask yourself: What would make this prompt specific and useful?
- Reference your class notes on R.C.T.F.

### "I don't understand what the section wants"
- The tutor explains each technique before asking you to do it
- Look at the example provided
- Identify what components the example includes
- Try to create something similar for your own scenario

### "Can I use my notes or templates?"
- YES! This is open-note
- You can reference your class materials
- You can look at your prompt templates
- Just don't copy-paste without customizing

### "What if I get a low score on a section?"
- The tutor offers you a chance to revise - TAKE IT!
- Read the feedback carefully
- Make specific improvements
- You can earn back up to 3 points per section

### "How do I know if I'm doing well?"
- The tutor gives you feedback after each section
- Scores of 12+ are excellent
- Scores of 10-11 are good
- Scores below 10 mean you should definitely revise
- Your scores should improve as you go through sections

## üéì What Happens After?

### Your teacher will:
- Review your conversation/screenshots
- Verify your scores
- May adjust scores slightly (¬±5-10 points)
- Use results to see if you need extra help

### You should:
- Read your final performance report carefully
- Note which techniques you're strong at
- Practice techniques you scored lower on
- Apply what you learned to real schoolwork!
