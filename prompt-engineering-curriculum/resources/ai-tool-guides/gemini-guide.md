## Best Practices for Student Use

### 1. Start with Clear, Specific Prompts

**Less Effective:**
```
"Tell me about World War 2"
```

**More Effective:**
```
"Explain the three main causes of World War 2, focusing on economic factors. Include specific examples from at least two countries."
```

### 2. Provide Context

Always tell Gemini:
- Your educational level (high school, college, specific course)
- The assignment or goal
- Any specific requirements or constraints
- Relevant background information

**Example:**
```
"I'm a high school junior studying AP Biology. I need to understand cellular respiration for my test next week. Can you explain the Krebs cycle using an analogy that's easy to remember?"
```

### 3. Ask for Explanations, Not Just Answers

**Instead of:**
```
"What's the answer to this calculus problem?"
```

**Try:**
```
"Can you walk me through how to solve this calculus problem step-by-step, explaining the reasoning behind each step?"
```

### 4. Use Gemini as a Study Partner, Not a Replacement

**Good Uses:**
- Explaining concepts you find confusing
- Generating practice problems
- Checking your understanding
- Exploring different perspectives
- Organizing your thoughts

**Avoid:**
- Copying responses directly for assignments
- Having Gemini do your work entirely
- Using it as a sole source for research
- Relying on it without verifying information

### 5. Verify Important Information

**Always:**
- Cross-check facts with authoritative sources
- Verify mathematical calculations
- Confirm citations and references
- Use multiple sources for research
- Consult primary sources when possible

### 6. Maintain Conversation Context

**Within a conversation, Gemini remembers previous messages:**
```
You: "Explain photosynthesis."
Gemini: [Explains photosynthesis]
You: "Now explain how it differs from cellular respiration."
Gemini: [Compares both, remembering previous explanation]
You: "Create a comparison table of these two processes."
Gemini: [Creates table using context from both previous responses]
```

### 7. Use Follow-Up Questions

Don't settle for the first response:
- "Can you elaborate on that point?"
- "What's a simpler way to understand this?"
- "Can you provide a specific example?"
- "How does this connect to [other concept]?"
- "What are the limitations of this explanation?"
