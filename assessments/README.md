## Feedback Guidelines

### Effective Feedback Characteristics

**Be Specific:**
- Point to exact prompt or skill
- Reference rubric criteria
- Give concrete examples

**Be Actionable:**
- Tell students exactly what to do next
- Provide steps for improvement
- Suggest specific practice activities

**Be Growth-Oriented:**
- Acknowledge progress made
- Frame challenges as opportunities
- Connect to learning goals
- Build confidence

**Be Timely:**
- Provide feedback while learning is fresh
- Allow time to apply feedback
- Create feedback loops

### Feedback Examples

**Instead of:** "Good job on prompts."
**Try:** "Your role-based prompts for math now include specific context about your grade level and what you already understand. This is helping AI personalize responses to your exact needs. Next, try adding information about how you learn best to make responses even more effective."

**Instead of:** "You need to work on iteration."
**Try:** "You're making good first attempts at prompts. I notice you usually stop after one try, even when the response isn't quite what you need. Practice refining prompts 2-3 times, making one specific improvement each time. Start with your math prompts this week."
