## 0:00-0:10 | Review & Integration Overview (10 min)

### Your Journey So Far

Think about where you started vs. where you are now:

**Session 1:** You learned to write effective prompts using role, context, task, and format.

**Session 2:** You mastered advanced techniques like multi-step, few-shot, and constraints.

**Session 3:** You discovered AI Studio and built reusable systems with meta-prompting.

**Today:** You become an independent AI user with your own complete system.

### See How Techniques Work Together

**Complex prompt example:**
```
You are an expert chemistry tutor working with a high school student.

I'm studying chemical equilibrium and understand Le Chatelier's principle
in theory, but I'm struggling to apply it to real problems. I tend to
get confused about which direction the equilibrium shifts.

Here's an example of how I want you to help:
Problem: "If we increase the pressure..."
Your response: "Let's think through this step by step. First, what
happens to the number of molecules when pressure increases?..."

Now help me with this problem: If we add more reactant A to the system
A + B ‚áå C + D, which direction does equilibrium shift?

Don't just tell me the answer‚Äîguide me to figure it out. Use questions
and step-by-step reasoning.
```

**Key question:** What techniques do you see in this prompt?

**Identify:** Role-based, context, few-shot, multi-step, constraints‚Äîall working together.

### Today's Mission

You'll build three things:
1. A personal prompt library you can use forever
2. Learning workflows for how you'll use AI
3. Ethical guidelines you can trust

**By the end, you'll have a complete AI learning system.**

## 0:10-0:25 | Building Your Prompt Library (15 min)

### Concept: A prompt library is an organized system of reusable prompts

A library is NOT just a list of random prompts‚Äîit's an organized system of prompts that solve your specific learning needs.

### Organization Methods

**Option 1: By Subject**
```
MY PROMPT LIBRARY

üìö BY SUBJECT
   - Math
   - Science
   - English
   - History

üéØ BY TASK TYPE
   - Explaining concepts
   - Checking my work
   - Practice problems
   - Essay help
   - Study guides

‚≠ê MY FAVORITES
   - Top 5 most-used prompts
```

### Creating Complete Library Entries

**Example entry:**

```
PROMPT NAME: Math Concept Explainer

SUBJECT: Mathematics (all levels)

TASK TYPE: Explaining concepts I don't understand

THE PROMPT:
You are a patient math tutor working with a [grade level] student.

I'm learning [topic] and specifically struggling with [what confuses me].
I already understand [what I do know] but I need help understanding
[specific question].

Please explain this concept using:
1. Simple language
2. A real-world analogy
3. A visual description or example
4. Then check my understanding with a question

Don't give me practice problems yet‚ÄîI need to understand the concept first.

NOTES ON USE:
- Fill in brackets with specifics
- Works best when I'm specific about what I do/don't understand
- Can ask follow-up questions in same conversation

VARIATIONS:
- Add "I'm a visual learner" for more diagrams/examples
- Add "I learn best with practice" to get problems after explanation

LAST USED: [date]
EFFECTIVENESS: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5)
```

**Note:** This is reusable, adaptable, documented.

### Exercise: Create Your Organization

**Practice (5 min):**
1. Choose your organization method (subject, task type, or hybrid)
2. Create at least 5 library entries
3. Use the template format shown above
4. Test at least one entry with current homework

**Tip:** Start with prompts you'll actually use this week.

### AI Studio Integration

Connect your library to AI Studio:
- Each saved chat can be a library category
- System instructions = reusable prompt foundation
- Create different configurations for different needs

**Try it:** Create a new chat in AI Studio with a system instruction from your library entry.

## 0:25-0:40 | Sustainable Learning Workflows (15 min)

### Concept: A workflow is a repeatable process for common academic tasks

A workflow is your step-by-step process for using AI for specific tasks. Instead of figuring it out each time, you have a proven system.

**Think of it like:** A recipe‚Äîfollow the steps, get consistent results.

### Example: Essay Writing Workflow

```
ESSAY WRITING WORKFLOW

Step 1: Brainstorming (no AI yet)
   - Read assignment carefully
   - Note initial thoughts
   - Identify what I don't understand

Step 2: Research Support (AI-assisted)
   - Use research prompts to understand context
   - Ask AI to explain historical background
   - Get different perspectives on topic

Step 3: Outline Development (AI-assisted)
   - Share my initial ideas with AI
   - Ask for feedback on logic flow
   - Request suggested evidence sources

Step 4: Draft Writing (minimal AI)
   - Write first draft myself
   - Use AI only for word choice or grammar questions

Step 5: Revision (AI-assisted)
   - Ask AI to critique argument strength
   - Request feedback on paragraph transitions
   - Check citation format

Step 6: Final Polish (minimal AI)
   - Final proofreading myself
   - Use AI only for unclear sentences
```

### Four Essential Workflows

**Workflow 1: Problem Set Assistance**
```
1. Attempt problems independently first
2. For stuck problems: identify exactly where I'm stuck
3. Use specific prompts to understand that step
4. Complete problem independently
5. Use AI to check work and reasoning
6. Learn from mistakes for next problems
```

**Workflow 2: Concept Mastery**
```
1. Read/attend lesson on concept
2. Note what I don't understand
3. Use explaining prompts for confusion points
4. Create examples myself
5. Use AI to verify understanding
6. Practice with AI-generated similar problems
```

**Workflow 3: Research & Writing**
```
1. Understand assignment requirements
2. Brainstorm independently
3. Use AI for background research
4. Develop thesis/argument myself
5. Use AI for feedback and gaps
6. Write with minimal AI assistance
7. Revise with AI feedback
```

**Workflow 4: Study & Test Prep**
```
1. Review materials and notes
2. Identify weak areas
3. Use AI to create practice tests
4. Take practice test without AI
5. Use AI to understand missed questions
6. Repeat for mastery
```

### Create Your Own Workflow

**Practice (5 min):**
1. Think about a task you do regularly in school
2. Map out: What steps? When use AI? When work independently?
3. Write it down using the format above

**Key question:** Which workflow would help you most right now?

### Building Workflows into Your Life

**Tips:**
- Start with ONE workflow, master it
- Once it's automatic, add another
- Your workflows will evolve‚Äîthat's normal
- Document what works so you can repeat it

**Connection:** Library = tools, Workflows = how you use them

## 0:40-0:55 | Academic Integrity Deep Dive (15 min)

### Concept: The line between helpful learning and academic dishonesty isn't always obvious

You need a framework for making good decisions independently.

**Important:** Your school may have specific policies‚Äîthose always come first.

### The Learning vs. Shortcutting Test

Ask yourself these questions:

```
1. UNDERSTANDING TEST
   ‚úì Can I explain this concept after using AI?
   ‚úó Did I just copy without understanding?

2. SKILL DEVELOPMENT TEST
   ‚úì Am I building skills I need to learn?
   ‚úó Am I bypassing skills I'm supposed to develop?

3. ASSIGNMENT PURPOSE TEST
   ‚úì Does AI help me meet the learning objectives?
   ‚úó Does AI let me avoid the intended learning?

4. INDEPENDENCE TEST
   ‚úì Could I do this without AI after learning with AI?
   ‚úó Will I always need AI for this task?

5. TRANSPARENCY TEST
   ‚úì Would I be comfortable telling my teacher how I used AI?
   ‚úó Am I hiding my AI use because I know it's wrong?
```

**If you answer the questions on the right, it's probably crossing the line.**

### Ethical Scenarios

**Scenario 1:**
You have a math problem set. You solve the first problem yourself but get stuck. You use AI to understand the concept, then solve the remaining problems independently.

**Decision:** ‚úì This is appropriate learning support

**Why?** You're using AI to understand, then applying that understanding independently.

---

**Scenario 2:**
You have an essay due tomorrow. You paste the prompt into AI and ask it to write the essay. You read it, make a few small changes, and submit it.

**Decision:** ‚úó This is academic dishonesty

**Why?** You bypassed all the learning the essay was meant to teach.

---

**Scenario 3:**
You're writing an essay and share your draft with AI asking: "What's weak about my argument? What evidence am I missing?" You then research those gaps and revise.

**Decision:** ‚úì This is appropriate feedback

**Why?** You're getting critique and doing the work to improve.

---

**Scenario 4:**
You use AI to explain a history concept, then write your analysis in your own words. You don't mention AI anywhere in your paper.

**Decision:** Gray area‚Äîdepends on school policy

**Why?** Some schools require citation of AI assistance. Know your school's rules!

---

**Scenario 5:**
It's test day. You're stuck on a question and secretly use AI on your phone under your desk.

**Decision:** ‚úó This is clearly cheating

**Why?** Tests measure what YOU know without assistance.

### When and How to Cite AI Use

Many schools now require citing AI assistance. Check your school's policy first.

**Example citations:**

```
In an essay:
"I used Google Gemini to understand the historical context of [topic]
and to provide feedback on my draft argument structure. All writing
and analysis are my own."

On problem sets:
"I used AI assistance to understand the concept of [concept] after
attempting problems 1-3 independently. I then applied this understanding
to complete the remaining problems without AI."

General acknowledgment:
"AI tools (Google Gemini) were used to support my learning and provide
feedback during the development of this work."
```

### Your Personal Ethical Guidelines

**Practice (5 min):**

Write your personal AI ethics statement:
- What are YOUR rules for AI use?
- What will you always do? Never do?
- How will you cite AI use?
- How will you make sure you're learning, not just completing?

**This becomes your compass going forward.**
