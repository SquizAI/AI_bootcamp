## Exercise 1A Solutions: Math Help

### 7th Grade - Ratios and Proportions

**Example Solution 1 (Direct Approach):**
```
Act as a patient middle school math teacher. I'm a 7th grader learning about ratios and proportions. I understand how to do basic multiplication and division, and I can solve simple ratio problems. However, I'm confused about when I should use a ratio versus when I should use a proportion—they seem similar to me. Can you explain the difference between them and give me a simple rule or guideline for knowing which one to use in different situations?
```

**What makes this work:**
- Clear role (patient middle school math teacher)
- Specific grade level (7th)
- States what they know (multiplication, division, simple ratios)
- Precisely identifies confusion (when to use which)
- Asks for practical guidance (rule or guideline)

**Example Solution 2 (Analogical Approach):**
```
Act as a middle school math tutor who's good at using everyday examples. I'm in 7th grade learning ratios and proportions. I can solve them both when I'm told which to use, but I can't tell which is which when I read a word problem. Can you explain the difference using an analogy or everyday situation I'd recognize, then show me how to spot which type of problem it is?
```

**What makes this work:**
- Role specifies teaching style (uses everyday examples)
- Identifies the real problem (can't distinguish in word problems)
- Requests specific format (analogy, then identification strategy)

### 9th Grade - Quadratic Equations

**Example Solution 1 (Conceptual Focus):**
```
Act as an algebra teacher for 9th graders. I know how to use the quadratic formula and can plug numbers into it correctly. What I don't understand is how to recognize when a problem needs the quadratic formula in the first place. There are other ways to solve equations, so how do I know when I'm looking at a situation that requires the quadratic formula? Can you explain the "signs" or characteristics of a quadratic equation problem?
```

**What makes this work:**
- States competency (can use the formula)
- Identifies the gap (recognition, not execution)
- Asks for diagnostic criteria (signs/characteristics)
- Shows understanding that there are multiple solution methods

**Example Solution 2 (Practice-Oriented):**
```
Act as a math tutor preparing me for tests. I'm in 9th grade algebra learning quadratic equations. I can solve them using the quadratic formula, but on tests I often use it when I shouldn't or miss using it when I should. Can you give me 3-4 example problems with explanations of how to decide which solution method to use, and create a decision flowchart or checklist I can refer to during tests?
```

**What makes this work:**
- Specifies the problem context (test situations)
- Identifies the specific difficulty (choosing solution method)
- Requests concrete tools (examples + decision flowchart)
- Practical application focus

### 11th Grade - Calculus Derivatives

**Example Solution:**
```
Act as a calculus teacher. I'm in 11th grade AP Calculus AB and I understand the basic derivative rules (power rule, sum/difference). I've learned the product rule and chain rule, but when I'm doing homework problems, I often choose the wrong one or don't see that I need to use them. Can you explain how to identify which rule a problem requires, maybe by showing me the "markers" or patterns I should look for in the function? Please use function notation and examples at the AP Calculus level.
```

**What makes this work:**
- Specifies course level (AP Calculus AB)
- Lists what they know (basic rules)
- Identifies precise problem (rule selection/recognition)
- Requests pattern recognition strategy
- Specifies appropriate difficulty level

## Exercise 1B Solutions: Science Explanation

### 7th Grade - Cell Structure

**Example Solution:**
```
Act as a 7th grade life science teacher who uses analogies. I know that cells are the building blocks of life and that there are plant cells and animal cells. What I'm confused about is what the actual differences are between them and why those differences exist—like, why do plants need different cells than animals? Can you explain this using an analogy to something I'd be familiar with, like comparing two types of buildings or machines?
```

**What makes this work:**
- Requests specific teaching style (uses analogies)
- States foundational knowledge
- Asks "what" and "why" (deeper understanding)
- Suggests analogy type (buildings/machines)

---

### 9th Grade - Chemical Reactions

**Example Solution:**
```
Act as a chemistry teacher for 9th graders. I understand that in a chemical reaction, reactants turn into products, and I can identify them in an equation. Where I'm stuck is balancing chemical equations—I don't understand WHY we need to balance them or HOW to know what numbers to use. Can you first explain the concept behind balancing (why it matters), then walk through a simple example step-by-step showing your thinking process, not just the procedure?
```

**What makes this work:**
- Clear competency stated (can identify reactants/products)
- Two-part confusion (why and how)
- Requests concept before procedure
- Asks for thinking process, not just steps
- Emphasizes understanding over memorization

---

### 11th Grade - Genetics

**Example Solution:**
```
Act as a biology teacher for 11th grade. I'm comfortable with basic Punnett squares and understand simple dominant/recessive inheritance. However, I'm confused about incomplete dominance and codominance—I know they're different from complete dominance, but I can't keep straight which is which or how to work problems with them. Can you explain both concepts by contrasting them with each other and with regular dominance, and give me a memory trick or way to keep them straight?
```

**What makes this work:**
- States foundation (comfortable with basics)
- Identifies specific concepts causing confusion
- Asks for comparative explanation (contrast all three)
- Requests practical memory aid
- Appropriate complexity for grade level

I have lots of ideas about what to include, but when I try to write, everything feels jumbled and I don't know what order to put things in. Can you help me understand how to organize a personal narrative? Please don't write it for me, but show me a structure or outline template I can use to arrange my ideas.
```

**What makes this work:**
- Clear assignment type (personal narrative)
- Identifies specific problem (organization, not ideas)
- Explicitly states what they DON'T want (AI writing for them)
- Requests structural tool (template)
- Maintains student ownership of content

### 9th Grade - Literary Analysis

**Example Solution:**
```
Act as an English teacher who helps with literary analysis. I'm writing a 5-paragraph analysis essay on [novel title] for 9th grade English. I have a thesis statement I'm happy with, but when I read my body paragraphs, they all sound the same—I keep explaining things the same way over and over. I need strategies for varying how I analyze the text without changing my main argument. Can you suggest 3-4 different types of analysis approaches I could use in different paragraphs, with brief examples of what each looks like?
```

**What makes this work:**
- Specifies exact assignment and grade
- Identifies what's working (thesis)
- Precisely defines the problem (repetitive structure)
- Clarifies the constraint (keep same argument)
- Requests specific, concrete strategies
- Asks for examples to model

---

### 11th Grade - Research Paper

**Example Solution:**
```
Act as a research writing tutor for advanced high school students. I'm writing an 8-10 page research paper on [topic] for 11th grade. I have 6 strong sources and understand each one individually, but I'm struggling to synthesize them—to show how they connect and build on each other rather than just summarizing each source separately. Can you explain strategies for synthesis in academic writing, and show me example sentences that demonstrate connection between multiple sources?
```

**What makes this work:**
- Appropriate complexity for grade/assignment
- Shows strong foundation (has sources, understands them)
- Identifies sophisticated writing challenge (synthesis)
- Requests both strategy explanation and models
- Academic language appropriate for level
